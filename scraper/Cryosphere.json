    "description": "This dataset contains gridded monthly global water storage/height anomalies relative to a time-mean, derived from GRACE and GRACE-FO and processed at JPL using the Mascon approach (RL06.1Mv03). This version of the data employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter that reduces signal leakage errors across coastlines. These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format, and can be used for analysis for ocean, ice, and hydrology phenomena. The water storage/height anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units (cm). The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions, rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients. Additionally, realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error. Thus, these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed, like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions. The complete Mascon solution consists of 4,551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equal-area 3-degree grid of individual mascons. A subset of these individual mascons span coastlines, and contain mixed land and ocean mass change signals. In a post-processing step, the CRI filter is applied to those mixed land/ocean Mascons to separate land and ocean mass. The land mask used to perform this separation is provided in the same directory as this dataset. Since the individual mascons act as an inherent smoother on the gravity field, a set of optional gain factors (for continental hydrology applications) that can be applied to the solution to study mass change signals at sub-mascon resolution is also provided within the same data directory as the Mascon data. This RL06.1Mv03 is an updated version of the previous Tellus JPL Mascon RL06Mv02 (DOI, 10.5067/TEMSC-3JC62). RL06.1Mv03 differs from RL06Mv02 only in the Level-1B accelerometer transplant data that is used for the GF2 (GRACE-FO 2) satellite; RL06.1Mv03 uses the ACH data product For more information, please visit https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/jpl_global_mascons/. For a detailed description on the Mascon solution, including the mathematical derivation, implementation of geophysical constraints, and solution validation, please see Watkins et al., 2015, doi: 10.1002/2014JB011547. For a detailed description of the CRI filter implementation, please see Wiese et al., 2016, doi:10.1002/2016WR019344.",

    "description": "The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.\n\nAn overview of NCA-LDAS and its capability for developing climate change indicators are provided in Jasinski et al. (2019).  Details on the data assimilation used in NCA-LDAS are described in Kumar et al. (2019).  Sample mean annual trends are provided in the NCA-LDAS V2.0 README document.\n\nThis NCA-LDAS version 2.0 data product was simulated for the continental United States for the satellite era from January 1979 to December 2016. The core of NCA-LDAS is the multivariate assimilation of past and current satellite based data records within the Noah Version 3.3 land-surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution using NASA's Land Information System (LIS; Kumar et al. 2006) software framework during the Earth observing satellite era. The temporal resolution is daily. NCA-LDAS V001 data will no longer be available and have been superseded by V2.0.\n\nNCA-LDAS includes 42 variables including land-surface fluxes (e.g. precipitation, radiation and latent and sensible heat, etc.), stores (e.g. soil moisture and snow), states (e.g., surface temperature), and routing variables (e.g., runoff, streamflow, flooded area, etc.), driven by the atmospheric forcing data from North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2; Xia et al., 2012). NCA-LDAS builds upon NLDAS through the addition of multivariate assimilation of earth observations such as soil moisture (Kumar et al, 2014), snow (Liu et al, 2015; Kumar et al, 2015a) and irrigation (Ozdagon et al, 2010; Kumar et al, 2015b). The EDRs that have been assimilated into the NCA-LDAS include soil moisture and snow depth from principally microwave sensors including SMMR, SSM/I, AMSR-E, ASCAT, AMSR-2, SMOS, and SMAP, irrigation intensity estimates from MODIS, and snow covered area from MODIS and from the multisensor IMS snow product.",

    "title": "JPL GRACE and GRACE-FO Mascon Ocean, Ice, and Hydrology Equivalent Water Height JPL Release 06.1 Version 03",
    "description": "This dataset contains gridded monthly global water storage/height anomalies relative to a time-mean, derived from GRACE and GRACE-FO and processed at JPL using the Mascon approach (RL06.1Mv03). These data are provided in a single data file in netCDF format, and can be used for analysis for ocean, ice, and hydrology phenomena. The water storage/height anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units (cm). The solution provided here is derived from solving for monthly gravity field variations in terms of geolocated spherical cap mass concentration functions, rather than global spherical harmonic coefficients. Additionally, realistic geophysical information is introduced during the solution inversion to intrinsically remove correlated error. Thus, these Mascon grids do not need to be destriped or smoothed, like traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions. The complete Mascon solution consists of 4,551 relatively independent estimates of surface mass change that have been derived using an equal-area 3-degree grid of individual mascons. It should be noted that this dataset does not correct for leakage errors across coastlines; it is therefore recommended only for users who want to apply their own algorithm to separate between land and ocean mass very near coastlines. This RL06.1Mv03 is an updated version of the previous Tellus JPL Mascon RL06Mv02 (DOI, 10.5067/TEMSC-3JC62). RL06.1Mv03 differs from RL06Mv02 only in the Level-1B accelerometer transplant data that is used for the GF2 (GRACE-FO 2) satellite; RL06.1Mv03 uses the ACH data product. For more information, please visit https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/jpl_global_mascons/.

Level-2 altimetry data provide surface elevations for ice sheets (GLAH12), sea ice (GLAH13), land (GLAH14), and oceans (GLAH15). Data also include the laser footprint geolocation and reflectance, as well as geodetic, instrument, and atmospheric corrections for range measurements. The Level-2 elevation products, are regional products archived at 14 orbits per granule, starting and stopping at the same demarcation (± 50° latitude) as GLAH05 and GLAH06. Each regional product is processed with algorithms specific to that surface type. Surface type masks define which data are written to each of the products. If any data within a given record fall within a specific mask, the entire record is written to the product. Masks can overlap: for example, non-land data in the sea ice region may be written to the sea ice and ocean products.

The model simulations resulted from a synthesis effort organized by the Permafrost Carbon Network to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the carbon cycle in permafrost regions in the high northern latitudes.  The model teams used different historical input weather data, but most used driver data developed by the Climate Research Unit - National Centers for Environmental Prediction (CRUNCEP) as modified for the Multiscale Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP).  The teams scaled the driver data for the projections using output from global climate models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The synthesis evaluated the terrestrial carbon cycle in the modern era and projected future emissions of carbon under two climate warming scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP45 and RCP85) from CMIP5. RCP45 represents emissions resulting in a global climate close to the target climate in the Paris Accord. RCP85 represents unconstrained greenhouse gas emissions.",

Climatological Summary Product contents contain monthly average of D1 quantities including mean diurnal cycle, distribution and properties of total cloudiness and cloud types.\r\n\r\nThe International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), the first project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), was established in 1982 (WMO-35 1982, Schiffer and Rossow 1983): \r\n- To produce a global, reduced resolution, calibrated and normalized radiance data set containing basic information on the properties of the atmosphere from which cloud parameters can be derived. \r\n- To stimulate and coordinate basic research on techniques for inferring the physical properties of clouds from the condensed radiance data set and to apply the resulting algorithms to derive and validate a global cloud climatology for improving the parameterization of clouds in climate models. \r\n- To promote research using ISCCP data that contributes to improved understanding of the Earth's radiation budget and hydrological cycle. \r\n\r\nSince 1983 an international group of institutions has collected and analyzed satellite radiance measurements from up to five geostationary and two polar orbiting satellites to infer the global distribution of cloud properties and their diurnal, seasonal and interannual variations. The primary focus of the first phase of the project (1983-1995) was the elucidation of the role of clouds in the radiation budget (top of the atmosphere and surface). In the second phase of the project (1995 onwards) the analysis also concerns improving understanding of clouds in the global hydrological cycle. \r\n\r\nThe ISCCP analysis combines satellite-measured radiances (Stage B3 data, Schiffer and Rossow 1985), Rossow et al. 1987) with the TOVS atmospheric temperature-humidity and ice/snow correlative data sets to obtain information about clouds and the surface. The analysis method first determines the presence of absence of clouds in each individual image pixel and retrieves the radiometric properties of the cloud for each cloudy pixel and of the surface for each clear pixel. The pixel analysis is performed separately for each satellite radiance data set and the results reported in the Stage DX data product, which has a nominal resolution of 30 km and 3 hours. The Stage D1 product is produced by summarizing the pixel-level results every 3 hours on an equal-area map with 280 km resolution and merging the results from separate satellites with the atmospheric and ice/snow data sets to produce global coverage at each time. The Stage D2 data product is produced by averaging the Stage D1 data over each month, first at each of the eight three hour time intervals and then over all time intervals.",

This data set contains 3-hourly, 280 KM equal-area grid data from various polar and geostationary satellites. The Gridded Cloud Product contents are spatial averages of DX quantities and statistical summaries, including properties of cloud types. Satellites are merged into a global grid. Atmosphere and surface properties from TOVS are appended. Data collection for this data set is complete. \r\n\r\nISCCP, the first project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), was established in 1982 (WMO-35 1982, Schiffer and Rossow 1983) to: produce a global, reduced resolution, calibrated and normalized radiance data set containing basic information on the properties of the atmosphere from which cloud parameters can be derived; stimulate and coordinate basic research on techniques for inferring the physical properties of clouds from the condensed radiance data set and to apply the resulting algorithms to derive and validate a global cloud climatology for improving the parameterization of clouds in climate models; and promote research using ISCCP data that contributes to improved understanding of the Earth's radiation budget and hydrological cycle. \r\n\r\nStarting in 1983 an international group of institutions collected and analyzed satellite radiance measurements from up to five geostationary and two polar orbiting satellites to infer the global distribution of cloud properties and their diurnal, seasonal and interannual variations. The primary focus of the first phase of the project (1983-1995) was the elucidation of the role of clouds in the radiation budget (top of the atmosphere and surface). In the second phase of the project (1995 onward) the analysis also concerns improving understanding of clouds in the global hydrological cycle. \r\n\r\nThe ISCCP analysis combined satellite-measured radiances (Stage B3 data, Schiffer and Rossow 1985), Rossow et al. 1987) with the TOVS atmospheric temperature-humidity and ice/snow correlative data sets to obtain information about clouds and the surface. The analysis method first determined the presence of absence of clouds in each individual image pixel and retrieves the radiometric properties of the cloud for each cloudy pixel and of the surface for each clear pixel. The pixel analysis was performed separately for each satellite radiance data set and the results were reported in the Stage DX data product, which had a nominal resolution of 30 km and 3 hours. The Stage D1 product was produced by summarizing the pixel-level results every 3 hours on an equal-area map with 280 km resolution and merging the results from separate satellites with the atmospheric and ice/snow data sets to produce global coverage at each time. The Stage D2 data product was produced by averaging the Stage D1 data over each month, first at each of the eight three hour time intervals and then over all time intervals.",

LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1 simulates peatland hydrology, permafrost dynamics, peatland vegetation, and methane emissions.The model processes can be simulated on an area-averaged 0.5 or 1.0 degree grid cell basis at global, regional, or site scales and on a daily, monthly, or annual time step as appropriate. Input driver data are monthly mean air temperature, total precipitation, percentage of full sunshine, annual atmospheric CO2 concentration, and soil texture class. The simulation for each grid cell begins from \"bare ground\", requiring a \"spin up\" (under non-transient climate) of ca. 1,000 years to develop equilibrium vegetation, carbon, and soil structure. Model simulations compare favorably, with some exceptions, to field observations collected from peatland sites (e.g., Degero, Sweden; Lakkasuo, Finland; BOREAS Northern Study Area, Canada; and others) and non-peatland sites (e.g., Point Barrow, Alaska, and Spasskaya, Siberia). LPJ-WHyMe is a further development of LPJ-WHy, which dealt with the introduction of permafrost and peatlands into LPJ. Implementing peatlands in LPJ required the addition of two new plant functional types (PFTs) (flood tolerant C3 graminoids and Sphagnum mosses) to the already existing ten PFTs, the introduction of inundation stress for non-peatland PFTs, a slow-down in decomposition under inundation, and the addition of a root exudates pool. LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1 adds a methane model subroutine. This model product has one compressed data file (*.zip) and seven companion files.",

The AGB estimates were derived from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) Level 1B2 Terrain radiance data and a multi-angle approach that exploits the relationship between forest AGB and a suite of red band reflectance values modeled at viewing angles with respect to the direction of illumination. The year 2000 National Biomass and Carbon Dataset (NBCD 2000) AGB estimates were used to fit a model coefficient for the MISR-derived AGB estimates for the year 2000, with AGB estimates for all subsequent years dependent on both this coefficient and MISR red band bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs). Quality assurance (QA) files are also provided that allow users to impose criteria of varying stringency. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model-fitting root mean square error (RMSE) value was used as one of the criteria to determine if the AGB estimates were reasonable. This dataset is the first example of forest AGB estimation based on a multi-angle index applied using MISR data.",

    "description": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is a critical parameter for monitoring the status of permafrost that is typically measured at specific locations using probing, in situ temperature sensors, or other ground-based observations. The thickness of the active layer is the average annual thaw depth, in permafrost areas, due to solar heating of the surface. This data set includes the mean Remotely Sensed Active Layer Thickness (ReSALT) over years 2006 to 2011 for the region near Barrow, Alaska. The data were produced by an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique that measures seasonal surface subsidence and infers ALT. ReSALT estimates were validated by comparison with ground-based ALT obtained using probing and Ground Penetrating Radar at multiple sites. These results indicate remote sensing techniques based on InSAR could be an effective way to measure and monitor ALT over large areas on the Arctic coastal plain.These data provide gridded (30-m) estimates of active layer thickness (cm; ALT) and seasonal subsidence (cm), as well as calculated uncertainty in each of these parameters.

    "description": "This data set consists of surface-based radiometer (SBR) brightness temperatures of the snow surface and vegetation at Grand Mesa, CO, USA, acquired during NASA's 2017 SnowEx campaign. Four SBRs were deployed in the field and obtained measurements at 89, 37, 19, and 10.67 GHz in both vertical (V-pol) and horizontal (H-pol) polarizations. Data are available for 37 locations across Grand Mesa collected over five days in February, 2017. They include both 2-4 minute observations and 20 minute, continuous measurements during surface melt, with the latter designed to capture the brightness temperature increase caused by the presence of liquid water in the snow. \n\nThis data set also contains snowfork measurements of snow wetness for 13 sites.",

MMOD was derived from the daily 19V (K-band) and 37V (Ka-band) GHz bands from the Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Calibrated Enhanced-Resolution Passive Microwave (PMW) EASE-Grid Brightness Temperature (Tb) Earth System Data Record (ESDR). The PMW MMOD dataset was validated using the transition date from Freeze Degree Days (FDD) to Thaw Degree Days (TDD) from in situ air temperature observations from 31 SNOw TELemetry network (SNOTEL) observations, and compared to the established Freeze-Thaw ESDR (FT-ESDR) spring onset date. The resulting MMOD data record is suitable for documenting the spatial-temporal impacts of MMOD variability in ecosystem services, wildlife movements, and hydrologic processes across the ABoVE domain. The data from 1988-2016 included a coastal mask removing coastal pixels due to potential water contamination from coarse brightness temperature observations (Dersken et al., 2012). There is not a coastal mask for the 2017-2018 data. The full data are included, and data users should be aware that coastal values can be adversely affected by adjacent water bodies.",

The photos were obtained from cameras mounted on\nhigh and  medium altitude aircraft based at the NASA Ames Research\nCenter.  Several  cameras with varying focal lengths, lenses and film\nformats are used, but  the Wild RC-10 camera with a focal length of 152\nmillimeters and a 9 by 9  inch film format is most common.  The positive\ntransparencies are typically  used for ancillary ground checks in\nconjunctions with digital processing for  the same sites.  The aircraft\nflights, specifically requested by scientists  performing approved\nresearch, often simultaneously collect data using other  sensors on       \nboard (e.g. Thematic Mapper Simulators (TMS) and Thermal Infrared \nMultispectral Scanners).  High altitude color infrared photography is\nused  regularly by government agencies for such applications as crop\nyield forecasting,  timber inventory and defoliation assessment, water\nresource management,  land use surveys, water pollution monitoring, and\nnatural disaster  assessment.\n\nTo order, specify the latitude and longitude of interest.  You will  then be\ngiven a list of photos available for that location.  In some cases,  \"flight\nbooks\" are available at EDC that describe the nature of the mission  during\nwhich the photos were taken and other attribute information.

It is a merged product containing separate snow and sea ice data sets. The values given are fractional coverage for 5-day intervals. Data collection for this data set is complete. \r\n\r\nThe data were collected on a global equal-area grid with the cell area equivalent to 1 degree latitude/longitude at the equator. The grid began at the South Pole with the intersection of the Greenwich meridian (0 degree longitude) and the South Pole as a cell corner. Ice/Snow Data Set contents included 5-day averages of snow and sea ice fractional coverage. Snow is deduced from visible satellite imagery plus ground data while sea ice was deduced from ship/shore and visible satellite imagery, and microwave measurements. \r\n\r\nISCCP was the first project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), to collect and analyze satellite radiance measurements to infer the global distribution of cloud radiative properties and their diurnal and seasonal variations. These data and analysis products were used to improve the understanding and modeling of the effects of clouds on climate. The ISCCP version of the ice/snow data set included only information concerning fractional coverage. The version actually used in the cloud analysis was changed in two ways: reductions to ice/snow presence and creation of margin zones in the data. The first of these was simply the process of converting the coded parameters in the original data set to code values that indicate only the presence or absence of sea ice and/or snow. The latter process filled in nearby grid cells in the data to indicate proximity to snow or sea ice covered locations. The second change is not included in the archived version of this data.",

    "description": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is a critical parameter for monitoring the status of permafrost that is typically measured at specific locations using probing, in situ temperature sensors, or other ground-based observations. The thickness of the active layer is the average annual thaw depth, in permafrost areas, due to solar heating of the surface. This data set includes the mean Remotely Sensed Active Layer Thickness (ReSALT) over years 1992 to 2000 for an area near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. The data were produced by an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique that measures seasonal surface subsidence and infers ALT. ReSALT estimates were validated by comparison with ground-based ALT measurements at multiple sites. These results indicate remote sensing techniques based on InSAR could be an effective way to measure and monitor ALT over large areas on the Arctic coastal plain.These data provide gridded (100-m) estimates of active layer thickness (cm; ALT), seasonal subsidence (cm) and subsidence trend (mm/yr), as well as calculated uncertainty in each of these parameters. This data set was developed in support  of NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) field campaign.The data are presented in one netCDF (*.nc) file. ",

    "description": "This NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) satellite Sigma-0 dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at Brigham Young University (BYU) and is generated using a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long. The SIR technique results in an enhanced resolution image reconstruction and gridded on an equal-area grid (for non-polar regions) at 4.45 km pixel resolution stored in SIR files; polar regions are gridded using a polar-stereographic technique. A non-enhanced version is provided at 22.25 km pixel resolution in a format known as GRD files. All files are produced in IEEE formatted binary. All data files are separated and organized by region, polarization, parameter, and sampling technique (i.e., SIR vs. GRD). The regions of China and Japan are combined into a single region. In additional to Sigma-0, various statistical parameters are provided for added guidance, including but not limited to: standard deviation, measurement counts, pixel time, Sigma-0 error, and average incidence angle.

Between 2016 and 2019 the GLacier and Land Ice Surface Topography Interferometer airborne (GLISTIN-A) radar measured surface elevations around the periphery of the Greenland Ice Sheet using Ka-Band (8.4 mm wavelength) single-pass interferometry. Level 2 (L2) GLISTIN-A elevation data, available on the JPL UAVSAR website (uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov), were collected each year in 81 swaths of varying lengths and 10-12km widths and then mapped to 3m horizontal grids. This Level 3 (L3) dataset was created to facilitate analysis of the year-to-year glacier surface elevation changes. Improvements over the L2 dataset include: a consistent swath numbering scheme (1 to 81) corresponding to repeated flight lines; common regular equal-area grids for each swath; filtering and flagging of outliers; an ancillary geoid layer; and UTM map projections corresponding to swath location. The interested user may generate their own L3 DEMs at different horizontal resolutions and projections using the Python 3 resample_GLISTIN_DEMs package available which will be available from https://github.com/NASA/resample_GLISTIN_DEMs",

Age class was recorded for moose based either on visual confirmation of an individual creating snow tracks or based on track dimensions. The ability to differentiate age classes for smaller ungulates was more uncertain, so age classes for deer, caribou, or sheep were not specified.

The DOQ combines the image characteristics of the original photograph with the georeferenced qualities of a map.\n\nDOQs are black and white (B/W), natural color, or color-infrared (CIR) images with 1-meter ground resolution.\n\nThe USGS produces three types of DOQs:\n\n1. 3.75-minute (quarter-quad) DOQs cover an area measuring 3.75-minutes longitude by 3.75-minutes latitude. Most of the U.S. is currently available, and the remaining locations should be complete by 2004. Quarter-quad DOQs are available in both Native and GeoTIFF formats. Native format consists of an ASCII keyword header followed by a series of 8-bit binary image lines for B/W and 24-bit band-interleaved-by-pixel (BIP) for color. DOQs in native format are cast to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and referenced to either the North American Datum (NAD) of 1927 (NAD27) or the NAD of 1983 (NAD83). GeoTIFF format consists of a georeferenced Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), with all geographic referencing information embedded within the .tif file. DOQs in GeoTIFF format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to NAD83. The average file size of a B/W quarter quad is 40-45 megabytes, and a color file is generally 140-150 megabytes. Quarter-quad DOQs are distributed via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) as uncompressed files.\n\n2. 7.5-minute (full-quad) DOQs cover an area measuring 7.5-minutes longitude by 7.5-minutes latitude. Full-quad DOQs are mostly available for Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Limited coverage may also be available for other states. Full-quad DOQs are available in both Native and GeoTIFF formats. Native is formatted with an ASCII keyword header followed by a series of 8-bit binary image lines for B/W. DOQs in native format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to either NAD27 or NAD83. GeoTIFF is a georeferenced Tagged Image File Format with referencing information embedded within the .tif file. DOQs in GeoTIFF format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to NAD83. The average file size of a B/W full quad is 140-150 megabytes. Full-quad DOQs are distributed via FTP as uncompressed files.\n\n3. Seamless DOQs are available for free download from the Seamless site. DOQs on this site are the most current version and are available for the conterminous U.S.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",
