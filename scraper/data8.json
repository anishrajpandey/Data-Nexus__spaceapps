The denominator increases as more persons are identified as pregnant or having been pregnant during the flu season. Cumulative vaccination coverage for one month may be lower than cumulative coverage for a previous month due to addition to the denominator of persons who are less likely to have received vaccination.","link":"https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Weekly-Cumulative-Influenza-Vaccination-Coverage-C/eudc-n39h","category":"health","tags":["api"]},{"title":"Vaccination Coverage among Nursing Home Residents","description":"This site provides historical data beginning June 14, 2023, for the visualization presented on COVID-19 Data Tracker’s “Vaccinations in the United States\"  site titled “US COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Delivered by Vaccine Type”","link":"https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccination-Coverage-among-Nursing-Home-Residents/8w4j-reb4","category":"health","tags":["api"]},{"title":"Cumulative Influenza Vaccination Coverage by Age Group, Race/Ethnicity, Urbanicity and Jurisdiction, NIS-ACM, Adults 18 Years and Older - NIS ACM","description":"Cumulative Influenza Vaccination Coverage by Age Group, Race/Ethnicity, Urbanicity and Jurisdiction, NIS-ACM, Adults 18 Years and Older, United States, National Immunization Survey-Adult COVID Module.
