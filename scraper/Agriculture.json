The GFCC Tree Cover Multi-Year Global dataset is available for four epochs centered on the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The dataset is derived from the GFCC Surface Reflectance product (GFCC30SR) (http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFCC/GFCC30SR.001), which is based on enhanced Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets. The GLS datasets are composed of high-resolution Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30 meter resolution. GFCC30TC provides tree canopy information and can be used to understand forest changes. Each tree cover product features four files associated with it; a tree cover layer with an embedded color map, a tree cover error (uncertainty) file, and an index (provenance) file, plus a list of path/rows that relate to the Surface Reflectance input files. Note that the index file and file list were not generated for the 2015 epoch. Data follow the Worldwide Reference System-2 tiling scheme. Additional details regarding the methodology used to create the data are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/146/GFCC_ATBD.pdf).\r\n",

    "description": "These data represent fractional land use and land cover patterns annually for the years 1500 - 2100 for the globe at 0.5-degree (~50-km) spatial resolution. Land use categories of cropland, pasture, primary land, secondary (recovering) land, and urban land, and underlying annual land-use transitions, are included. Annual data on age and biomass density of secondary land, as well as annual wood harvest, are included for each grid cell. Historical land cover data for the years 1500 - 2005 are based on HYDE 3.1 and future land cover projections for the period 2006 - 2100 came from four Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) scenarios which reach different levels of radiative forcing by year 2100: MESSAGE (8.5 W/m2), AIM (6 W/m2), GCAM (4.5 W/m2), and IMAGE (2.6 W/m2). A key feature of these data is that historical reconstructions of land use were harmonized (computationally adjusted to minimize differences at the transition period) with modeled future scenarios, allowing for a seamless examination of historical and future land use. The output data present a single consistent, spatially gridded set of land-use change scenarios for studies of human impacts on the past, present, and future Earth system. For additional information about the algorithms, inputs, and options used in creating the land use transitions data, please refer to Hurtt et al. (2006) and Hurtt et al. (2011).Data are presented as a series of twenty (20) different data products representing different past and future model scenarios. There are a total of 560 NetCDF v4 files (*.nc4), one for each combination of data product and land use variable.",

It provides Leaf Area Index (LAI) and diurnal courses of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Sunlit Leaf Area Index (SLAI), Fraction of incident Photosynthetically Active Radiation (400-700 nm) absorbed by the vegetation (FPAR), Directional Area Scattering Function (DASF), Earth Reflector Type Index (ERTI) and Canopy Scattering Coefficient at 443 nm, 551 nm, 680 nm and 779 nm. The VESDR files also include Solar Zenith Angle (SZA), Solar Azimuthal Angle (SAA), View Zenith (VZA), and Azimuthal (VAA) angles at the same temporal and spatial resolutions. The parameters are projected on eight regional 10 km SIN grids and available at 65 to 110 min temporal frequency. The version 2 VESDR product is generated from the upstream DSCOVR EPIC L2 MAIAC  (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction version 2) surface reflectance product. \r\n\r\n\r\nFPAR, LAI, and SLAI help monitor variability and change in global vegetation due to climate and anthropogenic influences, modeling climate, carbon, and water cycles and improving forecasting of near-surface weather. DASF provides information critical to accounting for structural contributions to measurements of leaf biochemistry from remote sensing. The canopy scattering coefficient is the Fraction of intercepted radiation reflected from or diffusely transmitted through the vegetation. This parameter is strongly correlated with leaf albedo, which depends on leaf biochemical constituents. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe also provide two ancillary science data products: \"Version 2 10 km Land Cover Type\" and \"Version 2 Distribution of Land Cover Types within 10 km EPIC pixel.\" The products were derived from 500m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover type 3 product (MCDLCHKM), which was generated from 2008, 2009, and 2010 land cover products (MCD12Q1, v051). \r\n\r\nA detailed description of the VESDR and ancillary science data products can be found in \"VESDR Science Data Product Guide, version 2\". Section \"USER'S GUIDE\" provides links to this document as well as to the two ancillary science data products.",

Intermediate products used to derive topsoil loss are provided and include 4 m gridded estimates of study sites elevation, curvature, slope, soil organic carbon index (SOCI), and the probability of exposed B-horizon soil. Topsoil loss at the county- and state-levels was derived from analyses of agricultural land at selected sites across the study area. From WorldView imagery, 759 fields were identified that had exposed bare soil (210 km2) and were grouped into 28 sites. Gridded estimates of the SOCI and of the probability of exposed B-horizon soil were determined for each field within the sites. Topography measures, including elevation (m), curvature (m-1), and slope (deg), were extracted over the entire study area from LiDAR-derived digital elevation models at a 4 m resolution acquired from 2003-2018. Within each of the 28 study sites, the SOCI and topographic curvature values were extracted from co-located pixels. Topsoil loss was estimated from the relationship between subsoil exposure and topography and averaged across each site.The relationship between topsoil loss and topographic curvature was used to up-scale and predict topsoil and economic losses at the county and state-levels across the entire 375,000 km2 study area. The data have been used to demonstrate a robust and scalable method for estimating the magnitude of erosion in agricultural landscapes.",

Estimates include uncertainty of field observations of aboveground and belowground combustion, as well as prediction uncertainty from a multiplicative regression model. To apply the model across all 2014 NWT fire perimeters, the final model covariates were re-gridded to a common 30-m grid defined by the Arctic Boreal and Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) Project. The regression model was then applied to burned pixels defined by a threshold of Landsat-derived differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) within fire perimeters.

The estimates include monthly average CO2 flux (gCO2 C m-2 d-1), daily average CO2 flux and error estimates by season (Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer), estimates of annual offset of CO2 uptake (i.e., vegetation GPP), annual budgets of vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP; gCO2 C m-2 yr-1), and the fraction of open (non-vegetated) water within each 300 m grid cell. Belowground sources of respiration (i.e., root and microbial) are included. The gridded soil CO2 estimates were obtained using seasonal Random Forest models, information from remote sensing, and a new compilation of in-situ soil CO2 flux from Soil Respiration Stations and eddy covariance towers. The flux tower data are provided along with daily gap-filled flux observations for each Soil Respiration station forced diffusion (FD) chamber record. The data cover the NASA ABoVE Domain.",

NCE estimates are for the combined crop plant harvest and consumption/expiration of fodder by livestock and of food by humans. Estimation of carbon uptake and release from global agricultural production and consumption required compilation and analysis of inventory data from various sources for the years 2005-2011. The flux estimates were spatially distributed to a global 0.05-degree resolution grid using MODIS land cover data. The quantities of carbon flux in each gridcell are represented in two ways: (1) where the quantities of carbon distributed to each gridcell were divided by the total gridcell area, resulting in average carbon fluxes per unit of total area (g C/m2/yr), and (2), where annual carbon fluxes associated with a source were summed over all types for the gridcell (Mg C/yr). The total surface area of the grid cells is provided.There are eight data files in netCDF format (.nc4) with this data set -- two files (per area and per gridcell) for each of the four flux source types.

    "description": "The aerial photography inventoried by the Pilot Land Data System \n(PLDS) at NASA AMES Research Center has been transferred to the USGS\nEROS  Data Center.  The photos were obtained from cameras mounted on\nhigh and  medium altitude aircraft based at the NASA Ames Research\nCenter.  Several  cameras with varying focal lengths, lenses and film\nformats are used, but  the Wild RC-10 camera with a focal length of 152\nmillimeters and a 9 by 9  inch film format is most common.  The positive\ntransparencies are typically  used for ancillary ground checks in\nconjunctions with digital processing for  the same sites.  The aircraft\nflights, specifically requested by scientists  performing approved\nresearch, often simultaneously collect data using other  sensors on       \nboard (e.g. Thematic Mapper Simulators (TMS) and Thermal Infrared \nMultispectral Scanners).  High altitude color infrared photography is\nused  regularly by government agencies for such applications as crop\nyield forecasting,  timber inventory and defoliation assessment, water\nresource management,  land use surveys, water pollution monitoring, and\nnatural disaster  assessment.\n\nTo order, specify the latitude and longitude of interest.  You will  then be\ngiven a list of photos available for that location.  In some cases,  \"flight\nbooks\" are available at EDC that describe the nature of the mission  during\nwhich the photos were taken and other attribute information.

    "description": "High resolution orthorectified images combine the image characteristics of an aerial photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. An orthoimage is a uniform-scale image where corrections have been made for feature displacement such as building tilt and for scale variations caused by terrain relief, sensor geometry, and camera tilt. A mathematical equation based on ground control points, sensor calibration information, and a digital elevation model is applied to each pixel to rectify the image to obtain the geometric qualities of a map.\n\nA digital orthoimage may be created from several photographs mosaicked to form the final image. The source imagery may be black-and-white, natural color, or color infrared with a pixel resolution of 1-meter or finer. With orthoimagery, the resolution refers to the distance on the ground represented by each pixel.\n",

These continental forest age maps were compiled from forest inventory data, historical fire data, optical satellite data, and the images from the NASA Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) project. These input data products have various sources and creation dates as described in the source paper by Pan et al. (2011). Canadian maps were produced with data available through 2004 and U.S.A. maps with data available through 2006. A supplementary map of the standard deviations for age estimates was developed for quantifying uncertainty.Note that the Pan et al. (2011) paper is included as a companion file with this data set and was the source of descriptions in the guide.Forest age, implicitly reflecting the past disturbance legacy, is a simple and direct surrogate for the time since disturbance and may be used in various forest carbon analyses that concern the impact of disturbances. By combining geographic information about forest age with estimated carbon dynamics by forest type, it is possible to conduct a simple but powerful analysis of the net CO2 uptake by forests, and the potential for increasing (or decreasing) this rate as a result of direct human intervention in the disturbance/age status.",

    "description": "This data set contains information that can be used to examine water fluxes in soils beneath tree crops in an Amazonian agroforest. The data consists of repeated measurements of soil matrix pressure and soil moisture content at several depths. The study was carried out at the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (Embrapa)-Amazonia Ocidental, 29 km North of Manaus, Brazil (3d 8m S, 59d 52m W, 40 - 50 m above sea level), in 1998 and 1999.Microaggregated tropical soils have shown high water conductivity even under unsaturated conditions in laboratory experiments. It is not clear, however, what depth the infiltrating soil water reaches during storm events under humid tropical conditions. Dynamics and fluxes of water were determined with high temporal resolution to a depth of 5 m in a Xanthic Hapludox of central Amazonia, Brazil. The soil water percolated to a depth of 0.9 m within 2 h of a rainfall event of 48 mm. Water fluxes were significantly slower below 0.9 m (17% of infiltration at 0 - 0.9 m) due to higher bulk densities. Percolation not only started rapidly after a rainfall event when soil water suction reached a certain threshold (ca. 20 - 30 hPa) but was also reduced to background levels less than 1 h after the rain had ended. The demonstrated extremely short-term dynamics of water fluxes have implications for measurement design of water availability and solute leaching in microaggregated tropical soil that require correct time integrals of solution concentrations and soil water dynamics. Measurement intervals of 30 min or less were necessary in our study. Rapid water flows may explain the observed high nutrient losses from the topsoil of microaggregated tropical soil and the large accumulation of nutrients in the deep soil (&gt; 5 m).",

    "description": "Tree and liana (vine) measurements were collected in a logging concession at the Fazenda Rohsamar in the municipality of Jurena in northwestern Mato Grosso. Tree identification and diameter measurements were collected between July 31, 2003 and October 14, 2003 on 10-m x 1000-m transects and the liana measurements were collected between August 5, 2003 and October 14, 2003 on 10 2-m x 1000-m transects within a 1400 ha logging block ( Feldpauschh et al. 2006). Liana transects were nested within tree census transects to relate total species data to the tree inventory. The biomass of lianas was calculated using two different allometric equations derived for lianas in Amazonian forests ( Gerwing and Farias, 2000; Gerwing et al. 2004). Comma-separated data files of measurements of (1) tree species (diameter &gt;10 cm), and forest characteristics, (2) measurements of liana diameter, forest characteristics, and calculated biomass, and (3) georeference points for the liana sampling transects are provided.Selective logging has become a dominant land-use in Brazilian Amazonia. Published data on forest biomass in southern Amazonia is sparse. As part of a larger study to evaluate the effect of reduced impact logging on carbon dynamics and nutrient stocks, forest structure, and forest regeneration potential, we conducted a pre-harvest campaign to estimate tree and liana biomass in a parcel of managed forest in northwestern Mato Grosso. Prior to logging in 2003, a scientific inventory was conducted in Block 5 of the logging concession(Figure 1). Tree characteristics for all trees and palms &gt; 10 cm DBH was measured by stratified sampling across the block to account for differences in tree densities (trees/ha). Transects were located using a commercial timber inventory to identify tree trunks approximately 10 cm DBH, lower and upper canopy height, species, and location of all individuals to the nearest 10 cm on an x-y grid. Diameter of all liana stems were included if their ultimate rooting point before ascending into the canopy fell within the transect. Lianas that had been cut due to reduced impact logging practices were also measured. Distance along the transect was recorded for each stem.",

    "description": "The objective of GEO is to fulfill a vision of a world where decisions and actions are informed by coordinated, comprehensive and sustained Earth Observation (EO). This is being pursued mainly through the added value of coordinating existing institutions, organized communities, space agencies, insitu monitoring agencies, scientific institutions, research centres, universities, modelling centres, technology developers and other groups that deal with one or more aspects of EO. To reach this overarching goal, GEO focuses on capacity development in three dimensions: infrastructure, individuals and institutions. In the field of agriculture, the general goal is to promote the utilization of Earth observations for advancing sustainable agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries. Key issues include early warning, risk assessment, food security, market efficiency and combating desertification. \n\n(Source: http://www.research-europe.com/index.php/2011/08/joao-soares-secretariat-expert-for-agriculture-group-on-earth-observations/)",

    "description": "Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring\n\nThe overarching goal of JECAM is to reach a convergence of approaches, develop monitoring and reporting protocols and best practices for a variety of global agricultural systems. JECAM will enable the global agricultural monitoring community to compare results based on disparate sources of data, using various methods, over a variety of global cropping systems. It is intended that the JECAM experiments will facilitate international standards for data products and reporting, eventually supporting the development of a global system of systems for agricultural crop assessment and monitoring. The JECAM initiative is developed in the framework of GEO Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOSS Task AG0703 a) and Agricultural Risk Management (GEOSS Task AG0703 b).",

    "title": "Global N Cycle: Fluxes and N2O Mixing Ratios Originating from Human Activity",
    "description": "Nitrogen is a major nutrient in terrestrial ecosystems and an important catalyst in tropospheric photochemistry. Over the last century human activities have dramatically increased inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr, the combination of oxidized, reduced and organically bound nitrogen) to the Earth system. Nitrogen cycle perturbations have compromised air quality and human health, acidified ecosystems, and degraded and eutrophied  lakes and coastal estuaries [Vitousek et al., 1997a, 1997b; Rabalais, 2002; Howarth et al., 2003; Townsend et al., 2003; Galloway et al., 2004]. To begin to quantify the changes to the global N cycle, we have assembled key flux data and N2O mixing ratios from various sources.  The data assembled from different sources includes fertilizer production from 1920-2004;  manure production from 1860-2004; crop N fixation estimated for three time points, 1860, 1900, 1995; tropospheric N2O mixing ratios from ice core and firn measurements, and tropospheric concentrations to cover the time period from 1756-2004.  The changing N2O concentrations provide an independent index of changes to the global N cycle, in much the same way that changing carbon dioxide concentrations provide an important constraint on the global carbon cycle.  The changes to the global N cycle are driven by industrialization, as indicated by fossil fuel NOx emission, and by the intensification of agriculture, as indicted by fertilizer and manure production and crop N2 fixation. The data set and the science it reflects are by nature interdisciplinary.  Making the data set available through the ORNL DAAC is an attempt to make the data set available to the considerable interdisciplinary community studying the N cycle.",

The goals of the campaign were to collect detailed measurements of precipitation at the Earth’s surface using ground instruments and advanced weather radars and to simultaneously collect data from satellites passing overhead.  A total of 15 stations were deployed near the South Fork River in North Central Iowa. The soil moisture probes measure hourly instantaneous measurements of the real dielectric permittivity, soil temperature, bulk electrical conductivity, and volumetric soil moisture.  This dataset also consists of precipitation amount, air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, wind speed, wind direction, and solar radiation measurements. The data files are available in ASCII-csv and Excel file formats.",

The overarching goal was to provide the most complete characterization of convective cloud systems, precipitation, and the environment that has ever been obtained, providing constraints for model cumulus parameterizations and space-based rainfall retrieval algorithms over land that had never before been available. Collected by a network of weather stations, this dataset is composed of 15 minute and 5 minute files with one file per site per day in mts format. Data can be read as ASCII text. Multiple parameters found in this dataset include relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed and direction, precipitation and calibrated soil moisture. More information on the contents and data format can be found at http://www.mesonet.org/index.php/site/about/mdf_mts_files.",

GCPEx addressed shortcomings in the GPM snowfall retrieval algorithm by collecting microphysical properties, associated remote sensing observations, and coordinated model simulations of precipitating snow. Data collected includes microwave brightness temperatures, snow and soil/snow-air interface (ground surface temperatures), soil surface temperatures, and soil volumetric water content. These data were acquired by multiple instruments: a passive microwave radiometer, a water content reflectometer, thermistors, soil moisture probe.",
