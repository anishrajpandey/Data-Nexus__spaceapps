    "title": "ECOSTRESS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Daily L2 Global 70m V001",
    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECO2LSTE Version 1 data product provides atmospherically corrected land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&amp;E) values derived from five thermal infrared (TIR) bands. The ECO2LSTE data product was derived using a physics-based Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. The ECO2LSTE is provided as swath data and has a spatial resolution of 70 meters (m).  The corresponding ECO1BGEO data product is required to georeference the ECO2LSTE data product. \r\n\r\nThe ECO2LSTE Version 1 data product contains layers of LST, emissivity for bands 1 through 5, quality control for LST&amp;E, LST error, emissivity error for bands 1 through 5, wideband emissivity, and Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV). For acquisitions after May 15, 2019, data products contain data values for TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 only. TIR bands 1 and 3 contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS as mentioned in the Known Issues section.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.",

The purpose of SRTM was to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth using radar interferometry. SRTM was a primary component of the payload on the Space Shuttle Endeavour during its STS-99 mission. Endeavour launched February 11, 2000 and ﬂew for 11 days.\r\n\r\nEach SRTMGL1 data tile contains a mosaic and blending of elevations generated by averaging all \"data takes\" that fall within that tile. These elevation files use the extension “.HGT”, meaning height (such as N37W105.SRTMGL1.HGT). The primary goal of creating the Version 3 data was to eliminate voids that were present in earlier versions of SRTM data. In areas with limited data, existing topographical data were used to supplement the SRTM data to fill the voids. The source of each elevation pixel is identified in the corresponding (SRTMGL1N) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMGL1N.003) product (such as N37W105.SRTMGL1N.NUM).\r\n\r\nSRTM collected data in swaths, which extend from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 kilometers (km). These swaths are ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 60° N and 56° S latitude. This accounts for about 80% of Earth’s total landmass. \r\n\r\n",

    "description": "The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Version 3 (ASTGTM) provides a global digital elevation model (DEM) of land areas on Earth at a spatial resolution of 1 arc second (approximately 30 meter horizontal posting at the equator).\r\n\r\nThe development of the ASTER GDEM data products is a collaborative effort between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). The ASTER GDEM data products are created by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) in Tokyo. \r\n\r\nThe ASTER GDEM Version 3 data product was created from the automated processing of the entire ASTER Level 1A (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) archive of scenes acquired between March 1, 2000, and November 30, 2013. Stereo correlation was used to produce over one million individual scene based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking was applied. All cloud screened DEMs and non-cloud screened DEMs were stacked. Residual bad values and outliers were removed. In areas with limited data stacking, several existing reference DEMs were used to supplement ASTER data to correct for residual anomalies. Selected data were averaged to create final pixel values before partitioning the data into 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude tiles with a one pixel overlap. To correct elevation values of water body surfaces, the ASTER Global Water Bodies Database (ASTWBD) (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/ASTWBD.001) Version 1 data product was also generated. \r\n\r\nThe geographic coverage of the ASTER GDEM extends from 83° North to 83° South. Each tile is distributed in GeoTIFF format and projected on the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96) geoid. Each of the 22,912 tiles in the collection contain at least 0.01% land area. \r\n\r\nProvided in the ASTER GDEM product are layers for DEM and number of scenes (NUM). The NUM layer indicates the number of scenes that were processed for each pixel and the source of the data.\r\n\r\nWhile the ASTER GDEM Version 3 data products offer substantial improvements over Version 2, users are advised that the products still may contain anomalies and artifacts that will reduce its usability for certain applications. \r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions \r\n• Expansion of acquisition coverage to increase the amount of cloud-free input scenes from about 1.5 million in Version 2 to about 1.88 million scenes in Version 3.\r\n• Separation of rivers from lakes in the water body processing. \r\n• Minimum water body detection size decreased from 1 km2 to 0.2 km2.

Compared to other coarser resolution (≥1km) satellite fire detection products, the improved 375 m data provide greater response over fires of relatively small areas, as well as improved mapping of large fire perimeters. Consequently, the data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity. The 375 m product complements the baseline Suomi NPP/VIIRS 750 m active fire detection and characterization data, which was originally designed to provide continuity to the existing 1 km Earth Observing System Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (EOS/MODIS) active fire data record. Due to frequent data saturation issues, the current 375 m fire product provides detection information only with no sub-pixel fire characterization.\r\n\r\nVNP14IMGTDL_NRT are available in the following formats: TXT, SHP, KML, WMS.

A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.  The CLIMCAPS algorithm uses data from the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) as a first-guess for the atmospheric state.  Because MERRA-2 products typically have a latency from 3 to 7 weeks, so too do the CLIMCAPS products. \n\nA level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.\n\n",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.\n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.\n\nThe 3-hourly data product was simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask. Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values. The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README. The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.",

    "title": "NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V002 (NLDAS_FORA0125_H) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This data set contains the primary forcing data \"File A\" for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2).  The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format is WMO GRIB-1. \n\nDetails about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing data sets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). \n\nThe non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).  NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between the NARR and\nNLDAS fields of terrain height.  This vertical adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.  The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are those employed in NLDAS-1, as presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).\n\nThe surface downward shortwave radiation field in \"File A\" is a bias-corrected field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave radiation.  This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in \"File A\" is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).\n\nThe precipitation field in \"File A\" is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology.  The precipitation is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order).  The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.  The field in \"File A\" that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in \"File B\"): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from NARR.\n\nThe hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two GRIB files, \"File A\" and \"File B\".  \"File A\" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven fields.  The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units. \n\nFor more information, please see the README Document.",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Only Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone.

The MOD21 Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm differs from the algorithm of the MOD11 (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/mod11_l2.061) LST products, in that the MOD21 algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MOD11 uses the split-window technique. The MOD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both the LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. \n\nThe MOD21A1D dataset is produced daily from daytime Level 2 Gridded (L2G) intermediate LST products. The L2G process maps the daily MOD21 (http://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21.061) swath granules onto a sinusoidal MODIS grid and stores all observations falling over a gridded cell for a given day. The MOD21A1 algorithm sorts through these observations for each cell and estimates the final LST value as an average from all observations that are cloud free and have good LST&amp;E accuracies. The daytime average is weighted by the observation coverage for that cell. Only observations having an observation coverage greater than a 15% threshold are considered.

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is GLDAS-2.1 Noah monthly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version. \n\nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency&amp;#8217;s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

The 3 arc second data was derived from the 1 arc second using averaging methods. (See Figure 3 in the User Guide (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/179/SRTM_User_Guide_V3.pdf).\r\n \r\nThe NASA SRTM data sets result from a collaborative effort by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA - previously known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, or NIMA), as well as the participation of the German and Italian space agencies. This collaboration aims to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of Earth using radar interferometry. SRTM was the primary (and virtually only) payload on the STS-99 mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which launched February 11, 2000 and ﬂew for 11 days.\r\n\r\nThe SRTMGL3 data were generated from SRTM1GL (https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMGL1.003) data that fall within that tile. These elevation files use the extension “.HGT”, meaning height (such as N37W105.SRTMGL3.HGT). The primary goal of creating the Version 3 data was to eliminate gaps, or voids, that were present in earlier versions of SRTM data. In areas with limited data, existing topographical data were used to supplement the SRTM data to fill the voids. The source of each elevation pixel is identified in the corresponding SRTMGL3N (https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMGL3N.003) product (such as N37W105.SRTMGL3N.NUM).\r\n\r\nThe SRTM swaths extended from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 kilometers (km), creating swaths ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 60° N and 56° S latitude to account for 80% of Earth’s total landmass.

    "title": "GLDAS Catchment Land Surface Model L4 3 hourly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V2.0 (GLDAS_CLSM10_3H) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data set, GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree 3-hourly, contains a series of land surface variables simulated from the Catchment Land Surface Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO’s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

    "title": "NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V2.0 (NLDAS_FORA0125_H) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This data set contains the primary forcing hourly data \"File A\" for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2).  The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB data files).\n\nThe non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).  NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between the NARR and NLDAS fields of terrain height.  This vertical adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.  The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).\n\nThe surface downward shortwave radiation field in \"File A\" is a bias-corrected field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave radiation.  This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in \"File A\" is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).\n\nThe precipitation field in \"File A\" is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology.  The precipitation is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order).  The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.  The field in \"File A\" that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in \"File B\"): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from NARR.\n\nThe hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two files, \"File A\" and \"File B\". \"File A\" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven meteorological forcing fields. Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2.0 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). \n",

    "title": "Gridded 6 hours Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_CONV_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose OMAervation, background and analysis errors at OMAervation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate OMAervation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the OMAerving system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, OMAervation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the OMAerving system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an OMAervation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of OMAervation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given OMAervation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded OMAervation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly. The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB format).\n\nMosaic was developed by Koster and Suarez (1994, 1996) to account for subgrid vegetation variability with a tile approach. Each vegetation tile carries its own energy and water balance and soil moisture and temperature.  Each tile has three soil layers, with the first two in the root zone. In NLDAS, Mosaic is configured to support a maximum of 10 tiles per grid cell with a 5% cutoff that ignores vegetation classes covering less than 5% of the cell. Additionally in NLDAS, all tiles of Mosaic in a grid cell have a predominant soil type and three soil layers with fixed thickness values of 10, 30, and 160 cm (hence constant rooting depth of 40 cm and constant total column depth of 200 cm). \n\nDetails about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Mosaic LSM can be found in Xia et al.

    "description": "The ASTER Global Water Bodies Database (ASTWBD) Version 1 data product provides global coverage of water bodies larger than 0.2 square kilometers at a spatial resolution of 1 arc second (approximately 30 meters) at the equator, along with associated elevation information. \r\n\r\nThe ASTWBD data product was created in conjunction with the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) Version 3 data product by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) in Tokyo. The ASTER GDEM Version 3 data product was generated using ASTER Level 1A (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) scenes acquired between March 1, 2000, and November 30, 2013. The ASTWBD data product was then generated to correct elevation values of water body surfaces.\r\n\r\nTo generate the ASTWBD data product, water bodies were separated from land areas and then classified into three categories: ocean, river, or lake. Oceans and lakes have a flattened, constant elevation value. The effects of sea ice were manually removed from areas classified as oceans to better delineate ocean shorelines in high latitude areas. For lake waterbodies, the elevation for each lake was calculated from the perimeter elevation data using the mosaic image that covers the entire area of the lake. Rivers presented a unique challenge given that their elevations gradually step down from upstream to downstream; therefore, visual inspection and other manual detection methods were required. \r\n\r\nThe geographic coverage of the ASTWBD extends from 83°N to 83°S. Each tile is distributed in GeoTIFF format and referenced to the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96) geoid. Each data product is provided as a zipped file that contains an attribute file with the water body classification information and a DEM file, which provides elevation information in meters. ",

The file format isnetCDF (converted from the GRIB data files).\n\nThe non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).

Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  NLDAS-2 is providing a second forcing file, \"File B\", in which the surface temperature, humidity, and wind fields are represented not at 2-meters and 10-meters above the height of the NLDAS terrain, but rather at the same height above the NLDAS terrain as the height above the NARR terrain of the lowest prognostic level of the NARR assimilation system (namely, the same height above the model terrain as the lowest prognostic level of the mesoscale Eta model, which is the assimilating model in NARR). \n\nThe surface downward surface radiation field in \"File B\" is taken directly from NARR, without any bias correction.  The precipitation and convective precipitation fields in \"File B\" are also taken directly from NARR, and are used to calculate the convective fraction provided in \"File A\".  The aerodynamic conductance is \"File B\" is also taken from NARR.\n\nThe hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two files, \"File A\" and \"File B\".  \"File B\" is the secondary (optional) forcing file and contains ten meteorological forcing fields.

The product is built on the EOS/MODIS fire product heritage [Kaufman et al., 1998; Giglio et al., 2003], using a multi-spectral contextual algorithm to identify sub-pixel fire activity and other thermal anomalies in the Level 1 (swath) input data. The algorithm uses all five 375 m VIIRS channels to detect fires and separate land, water, and cloud pixels in the image. Additional 750 m channels complement the available VIIRS multispectral data. Those channels are used as input to the baseline active fire detection product, which provides continuity to the EOS/MODIS 1 km Fire and Thermal Anomalies product.\r\n\r\nThe VIIRS 375 m fire detection data is a Level 2 product based on the input Science Data Record (SDR) Level 1 swath format.

    "title": "GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V2.1 (GLDAS_NOAH10_M) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products. \n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.\n\nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

    "description": "The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Version 3 (ASTGTM) provides a global digital elevation model (DEM) of land areas on Earth at a spatial resolution of 1 arc second (approximately 30 meter horizontal posting at the equator).\n\nThe development of the ASTER GDEM data products is a collaborative effort between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). The ASTER GDEM data products are created by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) in Tokyo. \n\nThe ASTER GDEM Version 3 data product was created from the automated processing of the entire ASTER Level 1A (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) archive of scenes acquired between March 1, 2000, and November 30, 2013. Stereo correlation was used to produce over one million individual scene based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking was applied. All cloud screened DEMs and non-cloud screened DEMs were stacked. Residual bad values and outliers were removed. In areas with limited data stacking, several existing reference DEMs were used to supplement ASTER data to correct for residual anomalies. Selected data were averaged to create final pixel values before partitioning the data into 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude tiles with a one pixel overlap. To correct elevation values of water body surfaces, the ASTER Global Water Bodies Database (ASTWBD) (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/ASTWBD.001) Version 1 data product was also generated. \n\nThe geographic coverage of the ASTER GDEM extends from 83° North to 83° South. Each tile is distributed in NetCDF format and projected on the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96) geoid. Each of the 22,912 tiles in the collection contain at least 0.01% land area. \n\nEach ASTGTM_NC data product contains a DEM file, which provides elevation information. The corresponding ASTGTM_NUMNC file indicates the number of scenes that were processed for each pixel and the source of the data.\n\nWhile the ASTER GDEM Version 3 data products offer substantial improvements over Version 2, users are advised that the products still may contain anomalies and artifacts that will reduce its usability for certain applications. \n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions \n• Expansion of acquisition coverage to increase the amount of cloud-free input scenes from about 1.5 million in Version 2 to about 1.88 million scenes in Version 3.\n• Separation of rivers from lakes in the water body processing. \n• Minimum water body detection size decreased from 1 km2 to 0.2 km2. \n",

The data set covers the period from May 2012, when the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission-1st Water GCOM-W1 satellite was launched, to the present.

GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data set, GLDAS-2.0 VIC 3-hourly 1.0 degree, contains a series of land surface variables simulated simulated with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO’s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

VCF products provide a continuous, quantitative portrayal of land surface cover at 250 meter (m) pixel resolution, with a sub-pixel depiction of percent cover in reference to the three ground cover components. The sub-pixel mixture of ground cover estimates represents a revolutionary approach to the characterization of vegetative land cover that can be used to enhance inputs to environmental modeling and monitoring applications. \n\nThe MOD44B data product layers include percent tree cover, percent non-tree cover, percent non-vegetated, cloud cover, and quality indicators. The start date of the annual period for this product begins with day of year (DOY) 65 (March 6 except for leap year which corresponds to March 5). \n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n",

Its land surface parameters, surface soil moisture, land surface (skin) temperature, and vegetation water content are derived from passive microwave remote sensing data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). Each swath is packaged with associated geolocation fields. The data set covers the period from May 2012, when the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission-1st Water GCOM-W1 satellite was launched, to the present, at a spatial resolution (nominally 46 and 31 km, respectively) of AMSR2's C and X bands (6.9/7.3 and 10.7 GHz, respectively).\n\nThe LPRM is based on a forward radiative transfer model to retrieve surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. The land surface temperature is derived separately from the AMSR2's Ka-band (36.5 GHz). A unique feature of this method is that it can be applied at any microwave frequency, making it very suitable to exploit all the available passive microwave data from various satellites.\n\nInput data are from the AMSR2 spatial-resolution-matched brightness temperatures (L1SGRTBR) product, archived at JAXA.",

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 8-Day Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers an 8-day period, or one-half of the Aqua orbit repeat cycle. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone.

Thus, MAC03S0 cross-track width is 11 pixels. Along-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.\n      \nIn the standard product, geolocation fields are calculated for each 1 km MODIS Instantaneous Field of Views (IFOV) for all orbits daily. The locations and ancillary information corresponds to the intersection of the centers of each IFOV from 10 detectors in an ideal 1 km band on the Earth's surface. A digital terrain model is used to model the Earth's surface. The main inputs are the spacecraft attitude and orbit, the instrument telemetry and the digital elevation model. The geolocation fields include geodetic Latitude, Longitude, surface height above geoid, solar zenith and azimuth angles, satellite zenith and azimuth angles, and a land/sea mask for each 1 km sample. Additional information is included in the header to enable the calculation of the approximate location of the center of the detectors of any of the 36 MODIS bands.

    "description": "The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.\n\nAn overview of NCA-LDAS and its capability for developing climate change indicators are provided in Jasinski et al. (2019).  Details on the data assimilation used in NCA-LDAS are described in Kumar et al. (2019).  Sample mean annual trends are provided in the NCA-LDAS V2.0 README document.\n\nThis NCA-LDAS version 2.0 data product was simulated for the continental United States for the satellite era from January 1979 to December 2016. The core of NCA-LDAS is the multivariate assimilation of past and current satellite based data records within the Noah Version 3.3 land-surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution using NASA's Land Information System (LIS; Kumar et al. 2006) software framework during the Earth observing satellite era. The temporal resolution is daily. NCA-LDAS V001 data will no longer be available and have been superseded by V2.0.\n\nNCA-LDAS includes 42 variables including land-surface fluxes (e.g. precipitation, radiation and latent and sensible heat, etc.), stores (e.g. soil moisture and snow), states (e.g., surface temperature), and routing variables (e.g., runoff, streamflow, flooded area, etc.), driven by the atmospheric forcing data from North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2; Xia et al., 2012). NCA-LDAS builds upon NLDAS through the addition of multivariate assimilation of earth observations such as soil moisture (Kumar et al, 2014), snow (Liu et al, 2015; Kumar et al, 2015a) and irrigation (Ozdagon et al, 2010; Kumar et al, 2015b).

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.\n\nThe 3-hourly data product was simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables.

    "description": "The MOD21 Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&amp;E) swath data product is produced daily in five minute temporal increments of satellite acquisition. The swath is approximately 2,030 pixels along track and 1,354 pixels per line, at a nadir resolution of 1,000 meters. The MOD21 Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm differs from the MOD11 (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/mod11_l2.061) algorithm in that the MOD21 LST algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MOD11 uses the split-window technique. The MOD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 2 (L2) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1399/MOD21_ATBD.pdf)).  \r\n\r\nValidation at stage 1 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity data products.

The view angle effects are removed from the directional reflectances, resulting in a stable and consistent NBAR product. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name.\r\n\r\nThe MCD43A4 provides NBAR and quality layers for MODIS bands 1 through 7.\r\n\r\nUsers are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications (https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006).\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\n*\tObservations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo on the ninth day of the 16-day period.\r\n*\tMCD43 products use the snow status weighted to the ninth day instead of the majority snow/no-snow observations from the 16-day period.\r\n*\tBetter quality at high latitudes from use of all available observations for the acquisition period.

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South at 1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North at 1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. The value for each grid box is the sum of the values that fall within the 1x1 area divided by the number of points in the box. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.",

The GFCC Surface Reflectance Estimates Multi-Year Global dataset is derived from the enhanced Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets for epochs centered on the years 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010. The GLS datasets are composed of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30 meter resolution. Data available for this product represent the best available “leaf-on” date during the peak growing season. The original GLS datasets were enhanced with supplemental Landsat images when data were incomplete for the epoch or inadequate for analysis due to acquisition during “leaf-off” seasons. The enhanced GLS data were acquired June 1984 through August 2011. Atmospheric corrections were applied to seven visible bands to estimate surface reflectance by compensating for the scattering and absorption of radiance by atmospheric conditions. GFCC30SR is a multi-file data product. The surface reflectance data products are used as source data for other datasets in the GFCC collection.\r\n\r\nFor each available date, data files are delivered in a zip folder that consists of six surface reflectance bands, a Top of Atmosphere temperature band, an Atmospheric Opacity layer, and the Landsat Surface Reflectance Quality layer. Data follow the Worldwide Reference System-2 tiling scheme.

    "title": "GLDAS VIC Land Surface Model L4 3 hourly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V2.1 (GLDAS_VIC10_3H) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product is for GLDAS-2.1 VIC 3-hourly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.

    "description": "The Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument measures surface mineralogy, targeting the Earth’s arid dust source regions. EMIT is installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and uses imaging spectroscopy to take mineralogical measurements of the sunlit regions of interest between 52° N latitude and 52° S latitude. An interactive map showing the regions being investigated, current and forecasted data coverage, and additional data resources can be found on the VSWIR Imaging Spectroscopy Interface for Open Science (VISIONS) EMIT Open Data Portal.\r\n\r\nThe EMIT Level 2B Estimated Mineral Identification and Band Depth and Uncertainty (EMITL2BMIN) Version 1 data product provides estimated mineral identification and band depths in a spatially raw, non-orthocorrected format. Each EMITL2BMIN granule contains two Network Common Data Format 4 (NetCDF4) files at a spatial resolution of 60 meters (m): Mineral Identification (EMIT_L2B_MIN) and Mineral Uncertainty (EMIT_L2B_MINUNCERT). The EMIT_L2B_MIN file contains the band depth (the depth of the identified spectral feature) and the identified mineral for each pixel. Two spectral groups, which correspond to different regions of the spectra, are identified independently and often co-occur. These estimates are generated using the Tetracorder system (code) and are based on EMITL2ARFL reflectance values. The EMIT_L2B_MINUNCERT file provides band depth uncertainty estimates calculated using surface Reflectance Uncertainty values from the EMITL2ARFL data product. The band depth uncertainties are presented as standard deviations. The fit score for each mineral identification is also provided as the coefficient of determination (r2) of the match between the continuum normalized library reference and the continuum normalized observed spectrum. Associated metadata indicates the name and reference information for each identified mineral, and additional information about aggregating minerals into different categories is available in the emit-sds-l2b repository and will be available as subsequent data products.\r\n\r\nThe EMITL2BMIN data product includes a total of 19 Science Dataset (SDS) layers. There are four layers for each of the Spectral Groups (Group 1 and Group 2): Mineral Identification, Band Depth, Band Depth Uncertainties, and Fit Score. Additional layers consist of geometric lookup table (GLT) x values, GLT y values, latitude, longitude, elevation, associated spectral library record, mineral name, URL for the spectral library description, spectral group, spectral library, and spectral group index. A browse image with Group 1 Band Depth, Group 2 Band Depth, Group 1 Band Depth Uncertainty, and Group 2 Band Depth Uncertainty is also included.\r\n\r\nEach granule is approximately 75 kilometer (km) by 75 km, nominal at the equator, and some granules near the end of an orbit segment reaching 150 km in length.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nThis product is generated to support the EMIT mission objectives of constraining the sign of dust related radiative forcing. Ten mineral types are the core focus of this work: calcite, chlorite, dolomite, goethite, gypsum, hematite, illite+muscovite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, and vermiculite. A future product will aggregate these results for use in Earth System Models. Additional minerals are included in this product for transparency but were not the focus of this product. Further validation is required to use these additional mineral maps, particularly in the case of resource exploration. Similarly, the separation of minerals with similar spectral features, such as a fine-grained goethite and hematite, is an area of active research. The results presented here are an initial offering, but the precise categorization is likely to evolve over time, and the limits of what can and cannot be separated on the global scale is still being explored. The user is encouraged to read the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) for more details.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Forecast (omf) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AMSUA_NOAA16_OMF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Tiled Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Instantaneous Level 2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2T_LSTE) Version 2 data product provides atmospherically corrected land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&amp;E) values derived from five thermal infrared (TIR) bands. The ECO_L2T_LSTE data product was derived using a physics-based Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. This tiled data product is subset from the ECO_L2G_LSTE data product using a modified version of the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) which divides Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zones into square tiles that are 109.8 km by 109.8 km with a 70 meter (m) spatial resolution.\r\nThe ECO_L2T_LSTE Version 2 data product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each band is distributed as a separate COG. This product contains seven layers including LST, LST error, wideband emissivity, quality flags, height, and cloud and water masks.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n* The User Guide for this product lists a view_zenith layer which is not included in the current version of this product.\r\n",

The data product was generated through temporal averaging of the reprocessed 3-hourly data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).  The land mask was modified to accommodate the river routing scheme included in the simulations in the fall 2019 update.  \n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.",

The data set covers the period from December 1997 to April 2015 (when the instruments on the TRMM satellite were shut down in preparation for its reentry into the earth's atmosphere), at the spatial resolution (nominally 45 km) of TMI's X band (10.7 GHz).\n\nThe LPRM is based on a forward radiative transfer model to retrieve surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. The land surface temperature is derived separately from TMI's Ka-band (37 GHz). A unique feature of this method is that it can be applied at any microwave frequency, making it very suitable to exploit all the available passive microwave data from various satellites.\n\nInput data are from the TMI Brightness Temperatures (1B-11) product, archived at the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC).",

The NPP/ VIIRS surface reflectance products are estimates of surface reflectance in each of the VIIRS reflective bands I1-I3, M1-M5, M7, M8, M10, and M11. VNP09GA is a Level-2G surface reflectance product produced on a 10km x 10km grid. The VNP09GA surface reflectance product is composed of all available surface reflectance observations for a given day over a set of tiles with global coverage. The tile numbering scheme and boundaries are the same as for MODIS. The first set of observations for each data set and grid cell are projected onto a two-dimensional grid and stored as 10km square tiles at 500m and 1 km resolution.\n\nSurface reflectance is obtained by adjusting top-of-atmosphere reflectance to compensate for atmospheric effects. Corrections are made for the effects of molecular gases, including ozone and water vapor, and for the effects of atmospheric aerosols. The inputs to the surface reflectance algorithm include top-of-atmosphere reflectance for the VIIRS visible bands (VNP02MOD, VNP02IMG), the VIIRS cloud mask and aerosol product (NPP-CMIP_L2), aerosol optical thickness (NPP_VAOTIP_L2, NPP_VAMIP_L2), and atmospheric data obtained from a reanalysis (surface pressure, atmospheric precipitable water, and ozone concentration).\n\nAll surface reflectance products are produced for daytime conditions only.

The MOD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both the LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. \n\nThe MOD21C1 dataset is produced daily from daytime Level 2 Gridded (L2G) intermediate LST products. The L2G process maps the daily MOD21 (http://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21.061) swath granules onto a sinusoidal MODIS grid and stores all observations falling over a gridded cell for a given day. The MOD21C1 algorithm sorts through these observations for each cell and estimates the final LST value as an average from all observations that are cloud free and have good LST&amp;E accuracies. The daytime average is weighted by the observation coverage for that cell. Only observations having an observation coverage greater than a 15% threshold are considered. The MOD21C1 product contains seven Science Datasets (SDS), which include the calculated LST as well as quality control, the three emissivity bands, view zenith angle, and time of observation.

    "description": "AMSR2/GCOM-W1 surface soil moisture (LPRM) L3 1 day 10 km x 10 km descending V001 is a Level 3 (gridded) data set. Its land surface parameters, surface soil moisture, land surface (skin) temperature, and vegetation water content, are derived from passive microwave remote sensing data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). There are two files per day, one ascending (daytime) and one descending (nighttime), archived as two different products. This document is for the nighttime product. The data set covers the period from May 2012, when the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission-1st Water GCOM-W1 satellite was launched, to the present.\n\nThe LPRM is based on a forward radiative transfer model to retrieve surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. The land surface temperature is derived separately from the AMSR2's Ka-band (36.5 GHz). A unique feature of this method is that it can be applied at any microwave frequency, making it very suitable to exploit all the available passive microwave data from various satellites.\n\nInput data are from the AMSR2 spatial-resolution-matched brightness temperatures (L1SGRTBR) product, nighttime passes, as processed using LPRM (i.e., LPRM/AMSR2/GCOM-W1 Downscaled Level 2 product, LPRM_AMSR2_DS_SOILM2_V001).",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product is for GLDAS-2.1 VIC monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask. Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values. The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README. The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

    "description": "The MYD21 Version 6.1 Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&amp;E) swath data product is produced daily in five minute temporal increments of satellite acquisition. The swath is approximately 2,030 pixels along track and 1,354 pixels per line, at a nadir resolution of 1,000 meters. The MYD21 Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm differs from the MYD11 (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/myd11_l2.061) algorithm in that the MYD21 LST algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MYD11 uses the split-window technique. The MYD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions.

    "description": "A suite of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&amp;E) products are available in Collection 6.1. The MOD21 Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm differs from the algorithm of the MOD11 (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/mod11_l2.061) LST products, in that the MOD21 algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MOD11 uses the split-window technique. The MOD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both the LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. \n\nThe MOD21C3 dataset is a monthly composite LST product that uses an algorithm based on a simple averaging method. The algorithm calculates the average from all the cloud free MOD21A1D (http://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21A1D.061) and MOD21A1N (http://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21A1N.061) daily acquisitions from the 8-day period. Unlike the MOD21A1 data sets where the daytime and nighttime acquisitions are separate products, the MOD21A2 contains both daytime and nighttime acquisitions as separate Science Dataset (SDS) layers within a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file. The LST, Quality Control (QC), view zenith angle, and viewing time have separate day and night SDS layers, while the values for the MODIS emissivity bands 29, 31, and 32 are the average of both the nighttime and daytime acquisitions.

The VNP43 data products are designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo product suite to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. The VNP43 data products are designed to promote the continuity of NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo data product suite.\r\n\r\nThe VNP43 algorithm uses the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model, with the three kernel weights from VNP43MA1 to reconstruct surface anisotropic effects, correcting the directional reflectance to a common view geometry (VNP43MA4), while also computing integrated black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon and white-sky albedo (WSA) (VNP43MA3). Researchers can use the BRDF model parameters with a simple polynomial, to obtain black-sky albedo at any solar illumination angle.

    "title": "ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model Attributes NetCDF V003",
    "description": "The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Version 3 (ASTGTM) provides a global digital elevation model (DEM) of land areas on Earth at a spatial resolution of 1 arc second (approximately 30 meter horizontal posting at the equator).\r\n\r\nThe development of the ASTER GDEM data products is a collaborative effort between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI). The ASTER GDEM data products are created by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) in Tokyo. \r\n\r\nThe ASTER GDEM Version 3 data product was created from the automated processing of the entire ASTER Level 1A (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) archive of scenes acquired between March 1, 2000, and November 30, 2013. Stereo correlation was used to produce over one million individual scene based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking was applied. All cloud screened DEMs and non-cloud screened DEMs were stacked. Residual bad values and outliers were removed. In areas with limited data stacking, several existing reference DEMs were used to supplement ASTER data to correct for residual anomalies. Selected data were averaged to create final pixel values before partitioning the data into 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude tiles with a one pixel overlap. To correct elevation values of water body surfaces, the ASTER Global Water Bodies Database (ASTWBD) (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/ASTWBD.001) Version 1 data product was also generated. \r\n\r\nThe geographic coverage of the ASTER GDEM extends from 83° North to 83° South. Each tile is distributed in NetCDF format and projected on the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96) geoid. Each of the 22,912 tiles in the collection contain at least 0.01% land area. \r\n\r\nEach ASTGTM_NUMNC file indicates the number of scenes that were processed for each pixel and the source of the data.. The corresponding ASTGTM_NC data product contains a DEM file, which provides elevation information. \r\n\r\nWhile the ASTER GDEM Version 3 data products offer substantial improvements over Version 2, users are advised that the products still may contain anomalies and artifacts that will reduce its usability for certain applications. \r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions \r\n• Expansion of acquisition coverage to increase the amount of cloud-free input scenes from about 1.5 million in Version 2 to about 1.88 million scenes in Version 3.\r\n• Separation of rivers from lakes in the water body processing. \r\n• Minimum water body detection size decreased from 1 km2 to 0.2 km2.

    "description": "The NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Albedo (VNP43IA3) Version 1 product provides albedo values at 500 meter (m) resolution for the bihemispherical reflectance white-sky albedo (WSA) and directional hemispherical reflectance black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon. The VNP43IA3 product is produced daily using 16 days of VIIRS data and is weighted temporally to the ninth day, which is reflected in the file name. The VNP43 data products are designed to promote the continuity of NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo data product suite.\r\n\r\nThe VNP43 algorithm uses the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model, with the three kernel weights from (VNP43IA1) (https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43IA1.001) to reconstruct surface anisotropic effects, correcting the directional reflectance to a common view geometry (VNP43IA4) (https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43IA4.001), while also computing integrated black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon and white-sky albedo (WSA) (VNP43IA3). Researchers can use the BRDF model parameters with a simple polynomial, to obtain black-sky albedo at any solar illumination angle. Likewise, both the BSA and WSA Science Dataset (SDS) layers can be used with a simple polynomial, to manually estimate instantaneous actual albedo (blue-sky albedo). Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/194/VNP43_ATBD_V1.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe VNP43IA3 product provides a total of 9 SDS layers including: BSA, WSA, and mandatory quality layers for VIIRS imagery bands: I1, I2, and I3. A low-resolution browse image is also available showing retrievals of WSA for band I1 in JPEG format.",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX2SUP. It is a new product produced using AIRS IR only because the radiometric noise in AMSU channel 4 started to increase significantly (since June 2007). The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product, plus intermediate outputs (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

    "description": "The NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/community/community-data-system-programs/measures-projects) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) Version 1 data product (VCF5KYR) provides global fractional vegetation cover at 0.05 degree (5,600 meter) spatial resolution at yearly intervals from 1982 to 2016. The VCF5KYR data product is derived from a bagged linear model algorithm using Long Term Data Record Version 4 (LTDR V4) data compiled from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is the ratio of the area of the vertical projection of green vegetation above ground to the total area, capturing the horizontal distribution and density of vegetation on the Earth’s surface. FVC is a primary means for measuring global forest cover change and is a key parameter for a variety of environmental and climate-related applications, including carbon land surface models and biomass measurements. The three bands included in each VCF5KYR Version 1 GeoTIFF are: percent of tree cover, non-tree vegetation, and bare ground. A water mask was applied with all pure water pixels (defined as ≥ 95% water coverage) set to zero.\r\n\r\nData from years 1994 and 2000 were excluded due to lack of data in the LTDR V4.",

    "description": "A new suite of MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity  (LST&amp;E) products are available in Collection 6.1. The MYD21 LST algorithm differs from the algorithm of the MYD11 (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/myd11_l2.061) LST products, in that the MYD21 algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MYD11 uses the split-window technique. The MYD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to retrieve dynamically both the LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the three MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. \n\nThe MYD21C1 Version 6.1 dataset is produced daily from daytime Level 2 Gridded (L2G) intermediate LST products. The L2G process maps the daily MYD21 (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD21.061) swath granules onto a sinusoidal MODIS grid and stores all observations falling over a gridded cell for a given day. The MOD21C1 algorithm sorts through all these observations for each cell and estimates the final LST value as an average from all observations that are cloud free and have good LST&amp;E accuracies. The daytime average is weighted by the observation coverage for that cell. Only observations having observation coverage more than a certain threshold (15%) are considered for this averaging. The MYD21C1 product contains seven Science Datasets (SDS), which include the calculated LST as well as quality control, the three emissivity bands, view zenith angle, and time of observation. Additional details regarding the methodology used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1399/MOD21_ATBD.pdf)).\n\nValidation at stage 1 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity data products. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the MYD21 data products are available from the MODIS Land Team Validation site (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/ValStatus.php?ProductID=MOD21).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* Three new CMG products are available in the MxD21 suite (MxD21C1/C2/C3).",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX3ST8. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 8-Day Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers an 8-day period, or one-half of the Aqua orbit repeat cycle. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.",

Its land surface parameters, surface soil moisture, land surface (skin) temperature, and vegetation water content, are derived from polarimetric microwave radiometer data from WindSat, onboard the Naval Research Laboratory's Coriolis satellite, using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). There are two files per day, one ascending (daytime) and one descending (nighttime), archived as two different products. This document is for the daytime product. The data set covers the period from February 2003 to July 2012.\n\nThe LPRM is based on a forward radiative transfer model to retrieve surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. The land surface temperature is derived separately from the WindSat's Ka-band (37.0 GHz). A unique feature of this method is that it can be applied at any microwave frequency, making it very suitable to exploit all the available passive microwave data from various satellites.\n                                  \nInput data are from the WindSat brightness temperatures (sdrLowRes) product, daytime passes, as processed using LPRM (i.e., LPRM/WindSat/Coriolis L2 product, LPRM_WINDSAT_SOILM2_V001).",

The algorithm calculates the average from all the cloud-free VNP21A1D and VNP21A1N daily acquisitions from the 8-day period. Unlike the VNP21A1 datasets where the daytime and nighttime acquisitions are separate products, the VNP21A2 contains both daytime and nighttime acquisitions as separate science dataset (SDS) layers within a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file.\r\n\r\nThe VNP21A2 product is developed synergistically with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST&amp;E Version 6 product (MOD21A2) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21A2.006) using the same input atmospheric products and algorithmic approach. The overall objective for NASA VIIRS products is to ensure the algorithms and products are compatible with the MODIS Terra and Aqua algorithms to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1332/VNP21_ATBD_V1.pdf). VIIRS LST&amp;E products are available 2 months after acquisition due to latency of data inputs.\r\n\r\nThe VNP21A2 product contains 11 Science Datasets (SDS): LST, quality control, view zenith angle, and time of observation for both day and night observations along with emissivity for bands M14, M15, and M16. Low-resolution browse images for day and night LST are also available for each VNP21A2 granule.\r\n",

The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team.

    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science). The ECOSTRESS Gridded Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Instantaneous Level 2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2G_LSTE) Version 2 data product provides atmospherically corrected land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&amp;E) values derived from five thermal infrared (TIR) bands. The ECO_L2G_LSTE data product was derived using a physics-based Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. This data product is a gridded version of the ECO_L2_LSTE (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L2_LSTE.002) Version 2 data product that was resampled using nearest neighbor, projected to a globally snapped 0.0006° grid, and repackaged as the ECO_L2G_LSTE data product. The ECO_L2G_LSTE product is provided as gridded data and has a spatial resolution of 70 meters (m). The ECO_L2G_LSTE Version 2 data product contains 8 layers distributed in an HDF5 format file including LST, LST error, wideband emissivity, height, view zenith angle, quality flags, and cloud and water masks. For acquisitions after May 15, 2019, data products contain data values for TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 only. TIR bands 1 and 3 contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS, as mentioned in the Known Issues section. LST data generated after May 15, 2019, will use only the three available bands; accuracy may be affected when compared to the LST data that utilized all five bands.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

The MYD21 Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm differs from the algorithm of the MYD11 (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/myd11_l2.061) LST products, in that the MYD21 algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MYD11 uses the split-window technique. The MYD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both the LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. \n\nThe MYD21A2 dataset is an 8-day composite LST product that uses an algorithm based on a simple averaging method. The algorithm calculates the average from all the cloud free MYD21A1D (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD21A1D.061) and MYD21A1N (httpd://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD21A1N.061) daily acquisitions from the 8-day period. Unlike the MOD21A1 data sets where the daytime and nighttime acquisitions are separate products, the MYD21A2 contains both daytime and nighttime acquisitions as separate Science Dataset (SDS) layers within a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file. The LST, Quality Control (QC), view zenith angle, and viewing time have separate day and night SDS layers, while the values for the MODIS emissivity bands 29, 31, and 32 are the average of both the nighttime and daytime acquisitions. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1399/MOD21_ATBD.pdf)).\n\nValidation at stage 1 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity data products. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the MYD21 data products are available from the MODIS Land Team Validation site (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/ValStatus.php?ProductID=MOD21).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The product utilizes GEOS data replacing MERRA2.\n* Three new CMG products are available in the MxD21 suite (MxD21C1/C2/C3).\n",

    "description": "This data set contains the monthly primary forcing data \"File A\" for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. \n\nThe NLDAS-2 monthly primary forcing data were generated from the NLDAS-2 hourly primary forcing data, as monthly accumulation for total precipitation, convective precipitation, and potential evaporation, and monthly average for other variables. The convective precipitation monthly total is the hourly convective fraction multiplied by the hourly precipitation (both from the NLDAS-2 \"File A\" files), and then summed over all hours of the month. Monthly period of each month is from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month. The one exception to this is the first month (Jan. 1979) that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979, except for the monthly accumulated  precipitation and convective precipitation that both start from 12Z 01 Jan 1979. \n\nA brief description about the NLDAS-2 hourly primary forcing data can be found from the GCMD DIF for GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORA0125_H_V002. \n\nDetails about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al. (2012).\n\nThe monthly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two GRIB files, \"File A\" and \"File B\".  \"File A\" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven fields.  The GRIBTAB file shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units. \n\nFor more information, please see the README Document.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Forecast (omf) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AMSUB_NOAA16_OMF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "title": "GLDAS Catchment Land Surface Model L4 monthly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V2.0 (GLDAS_CLSM10_M) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data set, GLDAS-2.0 monthly 1.0 degree, contains a series of land surface variables generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.0 3-hourly data simulated from the Catchment Land Surface Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO’s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder). The AIRS instrument is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n\nThis daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the specific quality control (QC) methodology. Specific QC accepts profile level from the top of the atmosphere down to the level where the QC determines that it is still good. Below this level, the data is rejected. \n\n",

The data are available annually from 2000 to 2015. MOD44W Version 6 is derived using a decision tree classifier trained with MODIS data and validated with the Version 5 MOD44W data product. A series of masks are applied to address known issues caused by terrain shadow, burn scars, cloudiness, or ice cover in oceans. A primary improvement in Version 6 is the generation of time series data rather than a simple static representation of water, given that water bodies fluctuate in size and location over time due to both natural and anthropogenic causes. Provided in each MOD44W Version 6 Hierarchical Data Format 4 (HDF4) file are layers for land, water, no data, and an associated per pixel quality assurance (QA) layer that provides users with information on the determination of water. \r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\n* Corrected for errors of many misplaced rivers in South America due to limited spatial resolution of previously used input data.\r\n* Improved data in the far northern latitudes.\r\n* Water extent provided as a time series that can be used to detect changes between 2000 and 2015.\r\n* Increased spatial resolution of 250 m.

    "description": "A suite of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&amp;E) products are available in Collection 6.1. The MOD21 Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm differs from the algorithm of the MOD11 (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/mod11_l2.061) LST products, in that the MOD21 algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MOD11 uses the split-window technique. The MOD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both the LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. \n\nThe MOD21A2 dataset is an 8-day composite LST product that uses an algorithm based on a simple averaging method. The algorithm calculates the average from all the cloud free MOD21A1D (http://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21A1D.061) and MOD21A1N (http://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21A1N.061) daily acquisitions from the 8-day period. Unlike the MOD21A1 data sets where the daytime and nighttime acquisitions are separate products, the MOD21A2 contains both daytime and nighttime acquisitions as separate Science Dataset (SDS) layers within a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file. The LST, Quality Control (QC), view zenith angle, and viewing time have separate day and night SDS layers, while the values for the MODIS emissivity bands 29, 31, and 32 are the average of both the nighttime and daytime acquisitions. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1399/MOD21_ATBD.pdf)).\n\nValidation at stage 1 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity data products. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the MOD21 data products are available from the MODIS Land Team Validation site (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/ValStatus.php?ProductID=MOD21).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The product utilizes GEOS data replacing MERRA2. \n* Three new CMG products are available in the MxD21 suite (MxD21C1/C2/C3).

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data set,  GLDAS-2.0 VIC monthly 1.0 degree, contains a series of land surface variables generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.0 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO’s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n\n\n",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX3STM. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 Monthly Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors.

This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the NOAA-20 platform, also known as JPSS-1. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 FSR (Full Spectral Resolution) infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2100-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.  The CLIMCAPS algorithm uses data from the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) as a first-guess for the atmospheric state.  Because MERRA-2 products typically have a latency from 3 to 7 weeks, so too do the CLIMCAPS products. \n\nA level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track.

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX3STM. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 Monthly Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.",

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other.

The consequences of these differences are described in the AIRS Near Real Time (NRT) data products document. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is produced using AIRS IR only because the radiometric noise in AMSU channel 4 started to increase significantly (since June 2007). The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. Estimates of the errors associated with these quantities is also part of the Standard Product.

    "title": "Soil Moisture Profiles and Temperature Data from SoilSCAPE Sites, USA",
    "description": "This data set contains in-situ soil moisture profile and soil temperature data collected at 20-minute intervals at SoilSCAPE (Soil moisture Sensing Controller and oPtimal Estimator) project sites in four states (California, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Michigan) in the United States. SoilSCAPE used wireless sensor technology to acquire high temporal resolution soil moisture and temperature data at up to 12 sites over varying durations since August 2011. At its maximum, the network consisted of over 200 wireless sensor installations (nodes), with a range of 6 to 27 nodes per site. The soil moisture sensors (EC-5 and 5-TM from Decagon Devices) were installed at three to four depths, nominally at 5, 20, and 50 cm below the surface. Soil conditions (e.g., hard soil or rocks) may have limited sensor placement. Temperature sensors were installed at 5 cm depth at six of the sites. Data collection started in August 2011 and continues at eight sites through the present. The data enables estimation of local-scale soil moisture at high temporal resolution and validation of remote sensing estimates of soil moisture at regional (airborne, e.g. NASA's Airborne Microwave Observation of Subcanopy and Subsurface Mission - AirMOSS) and national (spaceborne, e.g. NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive - SMAP) scales.",

    "description": "These data represent fractional land use and land cover patterns annually for the years 1500 - 2100 for the globe at 0.5-degree (~50-km) spatial resolution. Land use categories of cropland, pasture, primary land, secondary (recovering) land, and urban land, and underlying annual land-use transitions, are included. Annual data on age and biomass density of secondary land, as well as annual wood harvest, are included for each grid cell. Historical land cover data for the years 1500 - 2005 are based on HYDE 3.1 and future land cover projections for the period 2006 - 2100 came from four Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) scenarios which reach different levels of radiative forcing by year 2100: MESSAGE (8.5 W/m2), AIM (6 W/m2), GCAM (4.5 W/m2), and IMAGE (2.6 W/m2). A key feature of these data is that historical reconstructions of land use were harmonized (computationally adjusted to minimize differences at the transition period) with modeled future scenarios, allowing for a seamless examination of historical and future land use. The output data present a single consistent, spatially gridded set of land-use change scenarios for studies of human impacts on the past, present, and future Earth system. For additional information about the algorithms, inputs, and options used in creating the land use transitions data, please refer to Hurtt et al. (2006) and Hurtt et al. (2011).Data are presented as a series of twenty (20) different data products representing different past and future model scenarios. There are a total of 560 NetCDF v4 files (*.nc4), one for each combination of data product and land use variable.",

    "description": "The ASTER Surface Reflectance VNIR and Crosstalk Corrected SWIR (AST_07XT) dataset (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/996/ASTER_Earthdata_Search_Order_Instructions.pdf) contains measures of the fraction of incoming solar radiation reflected from the Earth’s surface to the ASTER instrument corrected for atmospheric effects and viewing geometry for both the Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) sensors. Each product delivery includes two Hierarchical Data Format - Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) files: one for the VNIR, and the other for the SWIR. They are distinguished from one another by a one-second difference in the production time that appears as part of the file name. Both the VNIR and SWIR data are atmospherically corrected and are generated using the bands of the corresponding (ASTER L1B) (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1B.003) image.\r\n\r\nAST_07XT is a multi-file product that contains atmospherically corrected data for both the VNIR and SWIR sensors. \r\n\r\nThe crosstalk corrected product no longer displays blurred images initiated by stray light that caused multiple reflections with the SWIR bands.\r\n\r\n ASTER Level 2 data requests for observations that occurred after May 27, 2020 will resort back to using the climatology ozone input. Additional information can be found in the ASTER L2 Processing Options Update (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/news/aster-l2-processing-options-update/).\r\n\r\nStarting June 23, 2021, radiometric calibration coefficient Version 5 (RCC V5) will be applied to newly observed ASTER data and archived ASTER data products. Details regarding RCC V5 are described in the following journal article.\r\n\r\nTsuchida, S., Yamamoto, H., Kouyama, T., Obata, K., Sakuma, F., Tachikawa, T., Kamei, A., Arai, K., Czapla-Myers, J.S., Biggar, S.F., and Thome, K.J., 2020, Radiometric Degradation Curves for the ASTER VNIR Processing Using Vicarious and Lunar Calibrations: Remote Sensing, v. 12, no. 3, at https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030427.\r\n\r\nAs of December 15, 2021, the LP DAAC has implemented changes to ASTER PGE Version 3.4, which will affect all ASTER Level 2 on-demand products.  Changes include:\r\n•\tAura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has been added as one of the ancillary ozone inputs for any observations made after May 27, 2020.  The sequence of fallbacks for ozone will remain the same.\r\n•\tToolkit has been updated from Version 5.2.17 to 5.2.20.  Users may notice minor differences between the two versions.  Differences may include minuscule changes in digital numbers around the peripheral of the granule and boundaries of a cloud for Surface Reflectance and Surface Radiance (AST07 and AST09) QA Data Plane depending on the Operating System and libraries being used by the user to process the data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Climatology, which is one of the inputs for Ozone and Moisture, Temperature and Pressures (MTP) will be removed from the Earthdata Order Form.  It has been observed that PGEs generated with Climatology as an input yield noticeable differences statistically during image and spectral analysis.  Climatology will continue to be used as the final default if neither of the first two selectable options are available for Ozone and MTP.  Users can check the OPERATIONALQUALITYFLAGEXPLANATION field in the metadata or the output file for atmospheric parameters that were applied\r\n",

The MOD21 Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm differs from the algorithm of the MOD11 (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/mod11_l2.061) LST products, in that the MOD21 algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MOD11 uses the split-window technique. The MOD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both the LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. \n\nThe MOD21C2 dataset is an 8-day composite LST product that uses an algorithm based on a simple averaging method. The algorithm calculates the average from all the cloud free MOD21A1D (http://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21A1D.061) and MOD21A1N (http://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21A1N.061) daily acquisitions from the 8-day period. Unlike the MOD21A1 data sets where the daytime and nighttime acquisitions are separate products, the MOD21A2 contains both daytime and nighttime acquisitions as separate Science Dataset (SDS) layers within a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file. The LST, Quality Control (QC), view zenith angle, and viewing time have separate day and night SDS layers, while the values for the MODIS emissivity bands 29, 31, and 32 are the average of both the nighttime and daytime acquisitions. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1399/MOD21_ATBD.pdf).\n\nValidation at stage 1 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity data products. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the MOD21 data products are available from the MODIS Land Team Validation site (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/ValStatus.php?ProductID=MOD21).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The product utilizes GEOS data replacing MERRA2. \n* Three new CMG products are available in the MxD21 suite (MxD21C1/C2/C3).

The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and AMSU (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit). The AIRS instrument is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS in combination with the AMSU constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n\nThis daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the specific quality control (QC) methodology. Specific QC accepts profile level from the top of the atmosphere down to the level where the QC determines that it is still good. Below this level, the data is rejected.\n\n",

    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Swath Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Instantaneous L2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2_LSTE) Version 2 data product provides atmospherically corrected land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&amp;E) values derived from five thermal infrared (TIR) bands. The ECO_L2_LSTE data product was derived using a physics-based Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. The ECO_L2_LSTE is provided as swath data and has a spatial resolution of 70 meters (m). The corresponding  ECO_L1B_GEO (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1B_GEO.002) data product is required to georeference the ECO_L2_LSTE data product.\r\nThe ECO_L2_LSTE Version 2 data product contains layers of LST, emissivity for bands 1 through 5, quality control for LST&amp;E, LST error, emissivity error for bands 1 through 5, wideband emissivity, Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV), cloud mask, and water mask. \r\nFor acquisitions between May 15, 2019, and April 28, 2023, data products contain data values for TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 only. TIR bands 1 and 3 contain fill values to accommodate direct streaming of data from the ISS. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

Biophysical Parameters derived from the FASIR-NDVI (Fourier Adjusted, Solar zenith angle correction, Interpolation, and Reconstruction of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data set developed for the ISLSCP Initiative II data collection for the months of January 1982 through December 1998 were used to calculate monthly mean surface albedos at 1 X 1 degree spatial resolution for vegetated land surfaces (Sellers et al, 1996b) for the wavelength interval from 0.4 to 3.0 mm. The instantaneous albedo is a function of the properties of the land surface and the solar zenith angle. The monthly mean albedo is an average weighted over time weighted by the incident radiation. NDVI data are used to generate the biophysical parameters leaf area index (LAI) and green fraction of vegetation (Greenness) used by the canopy radiative transfer model of the Simple Biosphere (SiB2) model (Sellers et al, 1996a), which computes the instantaneous albedo. This is coupled to the Colorado State University (CSU) General Circulation Model (GCM) (Randall et al, 1989) which integrates the SiB2 radiative transfer through time. The incident radiation for weighting the time-averaged albedo was provided by a previous run of the GCM using the atmospheric radiation parameterization of Harshvardhan et al (1987). The Harshvardhan parameterization models radiative transfer through the atmosphere in both the longwave and shortwave bands, including the effects of cloudiness and water vapor, carbon dioxide and ozone. The shortwave radiation distinguishes between the direct and diffuse components of the solar beam.",

Measurements were also taken over the Saudi Arabian desert with overlying desert dust, and Persian Gulf waters with some overlying aerosols. This experiment was a part of an international research effort in response to an environmental crisis, when over 600 oil wells in Kuwait were ignited by Iraqi forces in 1991. The resulting fires produced large plumes of smoke that had significant effects on the Persian Gulf region but limited global effects. Between May 16 and June 12, 1991, the Kuwait Oil Fire Smoke Experiment (KOFSE) was conducted in the Persian Gulf Region. The purpose of KOFSE was to determine the chemical and physical nature of the smoke and to investigate its potential effects on air quality, weather, and climate.\n\nThis data set consists of observations made with the CAR instrument and includes values for bidirectional reflectance factor at varying spectral bands.",

There are three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude. FASIR adjustments concentrated on reducing NDVI variations arising from atmospheric, calibration, view and illumination geometries and other effects not related to actual vegetation change.FASIR NDVI was also generated to provide inputs for computing a 17-year time series of associated biophysical parameters, provided as a separate data set in this data collection.

    "description": "The ASTER Digital Elevation Model (AST14DEM) product is generated (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/996/ASTER_Earthdata_Search_Order_Instructions.pdf) using bands 3N (nadir-viewing) and 3B (backward-viewing) of an (ASTER Level 1A) (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) image acquired by the Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) sensor. The VNIR subsystem includes two independent telescope assemblies that facilitate the generation of stereoscopic data. The band 3 stereo pair is acquired in the spectral range of 0.78 and 0.86 microns with a base-to-height ratio of 0.6 and an intersection angle of 27.7 degrees. There is a time lag of approximately one minute between the acquisition of the nadir and backward images. For a better understanding, refer to this (diagram) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/301/ASTER_Along_Track_Imaging_Geometry.png) depicting the along-track imaging geometry of the ASTER VNIR nadir and backward-viewing sensors.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of the new LP DAAC produced DEMs will meet or exceed accuracy specifications set for the ASTER relative DEMs by the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/81/AST14_ATBD.pdf). Users likely will find that the DEMs produced by the new LP DAAC system have accuracies approaching those specified in the ATBD for absolute DEMs. Validation testing has shown that DEMs produced by the new system frequently are more accurate than 25 meters root mean square error (RMSE) in xyz dimensions.\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\nAs of January 2021, the LP DAAC has implemented version 3.0 of the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation ASTER DEM/Ortho (SILCAST) software, which is used to generate the Level 2 on-demand ASTER Orthorectified and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) products (AST14). The updated software provides digital elevation extraction and orthorectification from ASTER L1B input data without needing to enter ground control points or depending on external global DEMs at 30-arc-second resolution (GTOPO30). It utilizes the ephemeris and attitude data derived from both the ASTER instrument and the Terra spacecraft platform. The outputs are geoid height-corrected and waterbodies are automatically detected in this version. Users will notice differences between AST14DEM, AST14DMO, and AST14OTH products ordered before January 2021 (generated with SILCAST V1) and those generated with the updated version of the production software (version 3.0). Differences may include slight elevation changes over different surface types, including waterbodies. Differences have also been observed over cloudy portions of ASTER scenes. Additional information on SILCAST version 3.0 can be found on the  SILCAST website (http://www.silc.co.jp/en/products.html).\r\n\r\nStarting June 23, 2021, radiometric calibration coefficient Version 5 (RCC V5) will be applied to newly observed ASTER data and archived ASTER data products. Details regarding RCC V5 are described in the following journal article.\r\n\r\nTsuchida, S., Yamamoto, H., Kouyama, T., Obata, K., Sakuma, F., Tachikawa, T., Kamei, A., Arai, K., Czapla-Myers, J.S., Biggar, S.F., and Thome, K.J., 2020, Radiometric Degradation Curves for the ASTER VNIR Processing Using Vicarious and Lunar Calibrations: Remote Sensing, v. 12, no. 3, at https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030427.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The CAM5K30EM data product was created by combining the University of Wisconsin-Madison MODIS Infrared Emissivity dataset (UWIREMIS) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset Version 4  (GED V4). The two datasets have been integrated to capitalize on the unique strengths of each product's characteristics.   \r\n\r\nThe integration steps include: adjustment of ASTER GED Version 3 emissivities for vegetation and snow cover variations to produce ASTER GED Version 4, aggregation of ASTER GED Version 4 emissivities from 100 meter resolution to the University of Wisconsin-Madison MODIS Baseline Fit (UWBF) 5 kilometer resolution, merging of the 5 ASTER spectral emissivities with the UWBF emissivity to create CAMEL at 13 hinge points, and extension of the 13 hinge points to high spectral resolution (HSR) utilizing the Principal Component (PC) regression method. Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the User Guide and Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/219/cam5k30_v2_user_guide_atbd.pdf).\r\n\r\nProvided in the CAM5K30EM product are layers for the CAMEL emissivity, ASTER Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), snow fraction derived from MODIS (MOD10), latitude, longitude, CAMEL quality, ASTER quality, and Best Fit Emissivity (BFE) quality information.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_SSMI_DMSP15_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.2 is new to the GES DISC archive and currently includes a main product from CLSM-F2.5 with Data Assimilation for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE-DA) from February 2003 to present.  The GLDAS-2.2 data are available in two production streams: one with GRACE data assimilation outputs (the main production stream), and one without GRACE-DA (the early production stream).  Since the GRACE data have a 2-6 month latency, the GLDAS-2.2 data are first created without GRACE-DA, and are designated as the Early Product (EP), with about 1 month latency.  Once the GRACE data become available, the GLDAS-2.2 data are processed with GRACE-DA in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Product archive. \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.2 Catchment Land Surface Model daily 0.25 x 0.25 degree with GRACE-DA. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.2 GARCE-DA product was simulated with Catchment-F2.5 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 24 land surface fields from February 1, 2003 to present.\n\nThe simulation started on February 1, 2003 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 Daily Catchment model simulation, forced with the meteorological analysis fields from the operational European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System.  The total terrestrial water anomaly observation from GRACE satellite was assimilated (Li et al, 2019). Due to the data agreement with ECMWF, this GLDAS-2.2 daily product does not include the meteorological forcing fields.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.2 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

The MCD19A1CMGL product is corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols using a new MAIAC algorithm that is based on a time series analysis and a combination of pixel- and image-based processing. The MODIS MAIAC products provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance, also referred to as Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF), as it would be measured at ground-level in the absence of atmospheric scattering or absorption. The Surface Reflectance dataset includes BRF, BRF normalized to a fixed geometry of solar zenith angle at 45° and nadir view, and Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) normalized to the nadir view and local sun angle at 1:30 pm.\r\n\r\nThe MCD19A1CMGL MAIAC Surface Reflectance product for land bands includes 25 Science Dataset (SDS) layers: BRF for bands 1-7, BRF normalized to a fixed geometry for bands 1-7, NBAR for bands 1-7, Quality Assessment (QA) bits, cosine of solar zenith angle, cosine of view zenith angle, and relative azimuth angle.

(See User Guide (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/179/SRTM_User_Guide_V3.pdf) Section 2.2.2.)\r\n\r\nThe combined image data set contains mosaicked one degree by one degree images/tiles of uncalibrated radar brightness values at 1 arc second. To create a smooth mosaic image, each pixel in an output is an average of all the image pixels for a location. Pixels with a value of zero (voids) were not counted. Because SRTM imaged a given location with two like-polarization channels (VV = vertical transmit and vertical receive, and HH = horizontal transmit and horizontal receive) and at a variety of look and azimuth angles, the quantitative scattering information was lost in the pursuit of a smoother image product unlike the SRTM swath image product SRTMIMGR (https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMIMGR.003), which preserved the quantitative scattering information.\r\n\r\nThe NASA SRTM data sets result from a collaborative effort by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA - previously known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, or NIMA), as well as the participation of the German and Italian space agencies. This collaboration aims to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of Earth using radar interferometry. SRTM was the primary (and virtually only) payload on the STS-99 mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which launched February 11, 2000 and ﬂew for 11 days.\r\n\r\nThe SRTM swaths extended from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 kilometers (km), creating swaths ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 60° N and 56° S latitude to account for 80% of Earth’s total landmass. \r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions \r\n* Voids in the Version 3.0 products have been filled with ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Version 2.0, the Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010), and the National Elevation Dataset (NED).",

    "description": "The ASTER Surface Kinetic Temperature (AST_08) is generated (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/996/ASTER_Earthdata_Search_Order_Instructions.pdf) using the five Thermal Infrared (TIR) bands (acquired either during the day or night time) between 8 and 12 µm spectral range. It contains surface temperatures at 90 m spatial resolution for the land areas only. Surface kinetic temperature provides a vital input to studies of volcanism, thermal inertia, surface energy, and high-resolution mapping of fires. This product is derived using the same algorithm as the ASTER Surface Emissivity (AST_05) (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_05.003) Product. \r\n\r\nSurface kinetic temperature is determined by applying Planck's Law using the emissivity values from the Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm, which uses atmospherically corrected ASTER surface radiance (TIR) data. The TES algorithm first estimates emissivity in the TIR channels using the Normalized Emissivity Method (NEM). These estimates are used along with Kirchoff's Law to account for the land-leaving TIR radiance that is due to sky irradiance. That figure is subtracted from TIR radiance iteratively to estimate the emitted radiance from which temperature is calculated using the NEM module.\r\n\r\n ASTER Level 2 data requests for observations that occurred after May 27, 2020 will resort back to using the climatology ozone input. Additional information can be found in the ASTER L2 Processing Options Update (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/news/aster-l2-processing-options-update/).\r\n\r\nStarting June 23, 2021, radiometric calibration coefficient Version 5 (RCC V5) will be applied to newly observed ASTER data and archived ASTER data products. Details regarding RCC V5 are described in the following journal article.\r\n\r\nTsuchida, S., Yamamoto, H., Kouyama, T., Obata, K., Sakuma, F., Tachikawa, T., Kamei, A., Arai, K., Czapla-Myers, J.S., Biggar, S.F., and Thome, K.J., 2020, Radiometric Degradation Curves for the ASTER VNIR Processing Using Vicarious and Lunar Calibrations: Remote Sensing, v. 12, no. 3, at https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030427.\r\n\r\nAs of December 15, 2021, the LP DAAC has implemented changes to ASTER PGE Version 3.4, which will affect all ASTER Level 2 on-demand products.  Changes include:\r\n•\tAura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has been added as one of the ancillary ozone inputs for any observations made after May 27, 2020.  The sequence of fallbacks for ozone will remain the same.\r\n•\tToolkit has been updated from Version 5.2.17 to 5.2.20.  Users may notice minor differences between the two versions.  Differences may include minuscule changes in digital numbers around the peripheral of the granule and boundaries of a cloud for Surface Reflectance and Surface Radiance (AST07 and AST09) QA Data Plane depending on the Operating System and libraries being used by the user to process the data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Climatology, which is one of the inputs for Ozone and Moisture, Temperature and Pressures (MTP) will be removed from the Earthdata Order Form.  It has been observed that PGEs generated with Climatology as an input yield noticeable differences statistically during image and spectral analysis.  Climatology will continue to be used as the final default if neither of the first two selectable options are available for Ozone and MTP.  Users can check the OPERATIONALQUALITYFLAGEXPLANATION field in the metadata or the output file for atmospheric parameters that were applied.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and AMSU (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit). The AIRS instrument is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS in combination with the AMSU constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km.\n\nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n\nThis daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the comprehensive quality control (QC) methodology. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables.\n\n",

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 0.25 degree monthly dataset.   \n\nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency&amp;#8217;s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) Level 2 Near Real Time (NRT) Support Retrieval (AIRS-only) product (AIRS2SUP_NRT_006) differs from the routine product (AIRS2SUP_006) in four ways to meet the three hour latency requirements of the Land Atmosphere NRT Capability Earth Observing System (LANCE): (1) The NRT granules are produced without previous or subsequent granules if those granules are not available within 5 minutes, (2) the predictive ephemeris/attitude data are used rather than the definitive ephemeris/attitude, (3) if the forecast surface pressure is unavailable, a surface climatology is used, and (4) no ice cloud properties retrievals are performed. The consequences of these differences are described in the AIRS Near Real Time (NRT) data products document. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is product produced using AIRS IR only because the radiometric noise in AMSU channel 4 started to increase significantly (since June 2007). The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product, plus intermediate outputs (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 scanlines. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

    "description": "This data set provides the results of (1) year-round measurements of methane (CH4) flux along with soil and air temperatures at five eddy covariance towers at sites located in the Alaskan Arctic tundra from June 2013 to December 2014 and (2) airborne CH4 and ozone (O3) measurements collected during Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) flight campaigns for years 2012 through 2014. The included site-level flux data at half-hourly intervals were calculated following standard eddy covariance data processing procedures. Also reported are daily mean methane flux, soil temperature with depth, and air temperature for each tower site. Also identified for each flux tower site were the \"zero curtain\" periods of extended cold when soil temperatures were poised near 0 degrees C. The reported CARVE airborne CH4 and O3 data were aggregated horizontally at 5 km intervals. Measurement heights are reported. These aircraft positions were treated as receptors in a Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model coupled with meteorology fields from the polar variant of the Weather and Research Forecasting model (WRF), in order to model the land surface influence on the aircraft-observed methane concentrations. The summed land surface influence on the aircraft data at each position is reported. For each airborne measurement, 2D surface influence fields (i.e. footprints) at two different spatial resolutions were derived using the WRF-STILT simulations. These gridded footprints are provided as netCDF formatted files.

    "description": "The Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets were generated to provide a 22-year satellite record of monthly changes in terrestrial vegetation. This data set contains three data files provided at spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in latitude and longitude with data from July 1981 through December 2002. New features include reduced NDVI variations arising from calibration, view geometry, volcanic aerosols, and other effects not related to actual vegetation change. In particular, NOAA-9 descending node data from September 1994 to January 1995, volcanic stratospheric aerosol correction for 1982-1984 and 1991-1994, and improved NDVI using empirical mode decomposition/reconstruction (EMD) to minimize effects of orbital drift. Global NDVI was generated to provide inputs for computing the time series of biophysical parameters contained in the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II collection. NDVI is used in climate models and biogeochemical models to calculate photosynthesis, the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the land surface, land-surface evapotranspiration and the absorption and release of energy by the land surface.

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005).

With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available.

The GFSAD30SAAFGIRCE data product uses the pixel-based supervised classifier, Random Forest (RF), to retrieve cropland extent from a combination of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and elevation derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Version 3 data products. Each GFSAD30SAAFGIRCE GeoTIFF file contains a cropland extent layer that defines areas of cropland, non-cropland, and water bodies over a 10° by 10° area.\r\n",

    "title": "ISLSCP II IGBP DISCover and SiB Land Cover, 1992-1993",
    "description": "This data set describes the geographic distributions of 17 classes of land cover based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere DISCover land cover legend (Loveland and Belward 1997) and the 15 classes of the SiB model processed at the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC). Specifically, the resampled DISCover datasets were derived from the 1km DISCover data set compiled by the USGS. The 1km data sets for each classification scheme were aggregated to 1, 0.5 and 0.25 degree spatial resolutions for this ISLSCP II data collection. Each layer of the aggregated products corresponds to a single DISCover land cover category and the values represent the percentage of the coarse resolution cell (1 degree, etc...)occupied by that land cover category. The dominant class data show the land cover category that occupies the majority of the cell and is derived from the percentage files for each cover type. The objective of this study was to create a land cover map derived from 1 kilometer AVHRR data using a full year of data (April 1992-March 1993). This thematic map was resampled to 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree grids for the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) data initiative II. During this re-processing, the original EDC land cover type and fraction maps were adjusted to match the water/land fraction of the ISLSCP II land/water mask. These maps were generated for use by global modelers and others. This data set is one of the products of the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP II) data collection which contains 50 global time series data sets for the ten-year period 1986 to 1995. Selected data sets span even longer periods. ISLSCP II is a consistent collection of data sets that were compiled from existing data sources and algorithms, and were designed to satisfy the needs of modelers and investigators of the global carbon, water and energy cycle. The data were acquired from a number of U.S. and international agencies, universities, and institutions. The global data sets were mapped at consistent spatial (1, 0.5 and 0.25 degrees) and temporal (monthly, with meteorological data at finer (e.g., 3-hour)) resolutions and reformatted into a common ASCII format. The data and documentation have undergone two peer reviews.ISLSCP is one of several projects of Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) [http://www.gewex.org/] and has the lead role in addressing land-atmosphere interactions -- process modeling, data retrieval algorithms, field experiment design and execution, and the development of global data sets.",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors.

    "description": "AMSR-E/Aqua surface soil moisture (LSMEM) L3 1 day 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree V001 is a global, 10-year (2002-2011) data set. It is created from soil moisture retrieved from passive microwave brightness temperatures measured by the 10.65 and 36.5 GHz radiometers on the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor on the NASA Aqua satellite. The retrieval algorithm is based on Princeton's Land Surface Microwave Emission Model (LSMEM), a physically-based radiative transfer model, and serves as the core algorithm in the estimation procedure. To retrieve surface soil moisture, two unknowns, the soil moisture and the effective vegetation optical depth, are simultaneously solved from two radiative transfer equations in LSMEM, one for the 10.65 GHz horizontally-polarized brightness temperature and the other for the 10.65 GHz vertically-polarized brightness temperature. The land surface temperature required in the estimation procedure is estimated from the 36.5 GHz vertically-polarized brightness temperature, using a regression relationship. This soil moisture product does not include areas covered by snow, so the snow model is not described. Also, the atmosphere is assumed to have constant brightness temperatures; therefore, the atmosphere model is also not described.",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX2SUP. However, it contains science retrievals that use the HSB. Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product, plus intermediate outputs (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. \n\nAn AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data with 30 footprints cross track by 45 scanlines of AMSU-A data or 135 scanlines of AIRS and HSB data. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

    "description": "DISCOVER-AQ, a NASA Earth Venture program funded mission, stands for Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality.\nIn recent years, progress in reaching air quality goals has begun to plateau for many locations. Furthermore, near-surface pollution is one of the most challenging problems for Earth observations from space. However, with an improved ability to monitor pollution from satellites from DISCOVER-AQ, scientists could make better air quality forecasts, more accurately determine the sources of pollutants in the air and more closely determine the fluctuations in emissions levels. In short, the more accurate data scientists have at hand, the better society is able to deal effectively with lingering pollution problems. During the DISCOVER-AQ mission in 2014, the CAR instrument was flown aboard NASA P-3 aircraft and obtained measurements of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) at different scales over agricultural and urban areas in Colorado, USA. \n\nThis data set consists of observations made with the CAR instrument and includes values for bidirectional reflectance factor at varying spectral bands.",

The data were generated using SnowModel and used as snow covariates along with landscape covariates in modeling efforts to study Dall sheep movements in response to dynamic snow conditions. Thirty adult Dall sheep (12 male, 18 female) were captured and outfitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars programmed to acquire locations every seven hours. Given the individual sheep locations, their distances to land cover (e.g., shrub, forest, glacier), landscape characteristics (e.g., elevation, terrain ruggedness index (TRI), vector ruggedness measure (VRM), slope, and aspect), snow depth and density, MODIS normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and other covariates were determined and are provided in the environmental data file. The snow density and depth data are provided at 25-m, 100-m, 500-m, 2000-m, and 10000-m grid resolutions, at 1-day increments, and cover the period September 1, 2005 through August 31, 2008.

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "title": "ECOSTRESS Swath Geolocation Instantaneous L1B Global 70 m V002",
    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Swath Geolocation Instantaneous Level 1B Global (ECO_L1B_GEO) Version 2 data product provides the geolocation information for the radiance values retrieved in the ECO_L1B_RAD (https://doi.org/10.5067/ecostress/eco_l1b_rad.002) Version 2 data product. The geolocation product gives geo-tagging to each of the radiance pixels. The geolocation processing corrects the ISS-reported ephemeris and attitude data by image matching with a global ortho-base derived from Landsat data, and then assigns latitude and longitude values to each of the Level 1 radiance pixels. When image matching is successful, the data are geolocated to better than 50 meter (m) accuracy. The ECO_L1B_GEO data product is provided as swath data.\r\nThe ECO_L1B_GEO data product contains data layers for latitude and longitude values, solar and view geometry information, surface height, and the fraction of pixel on land versus water distributed in HDF5 format.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Geolocation accuracy: In cases where scenes were not successfully matched with the ortho-base, the geolocation error is significantly larger; the worst-case geolocation error for uncorrected data is 7 kilometers (km). Within the metadata of the ECO_L1B_GEO file, if the field \"L1GEOMetadata/OrbitCorrectionPerformed\" is \"True\", the data was corrected, and geolocation accuracy should be better than 50 m. If this field is \"False\", then the data was processed without correcting the geolocation and will have up to 7 km geolocation error.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: EECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

    "description": "A new suite of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&amp;E) products are available in Collection 6.1. The MYD21 Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm differs from the algorithm of the MYD11 (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/myd11_l2.061) LST products, in that the MYD21 algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MYD11 uses the split-window technique. The MYD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both the LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. \n\nThe MYD21C3 dataset is an 8-day composite LST product that uses an algorithm based on a simple averaging method. The algorithm calculates the average from all the cloud free MYD21A1D (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD21A1D.061) and MYD21A1N (http://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD21A1N.061) daily acquisitions from the 8-day period. Unlike the MOD21A1 data sets where the daytime and nighttime acquisitions are separate products, the MYD21A2 contains both daytime and nighttime acquisitions as separate Science Dataset (SDS) layers within a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file. The LST, Quality Control (QC), view zenith angle, and viewing time have separate day and night SDS layers, while the values for the MODIS emissivity bands 29, 31, and 32 are the average of both the nighttime and daytime acquisitions. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1399/MOD21_ATBD.pdf)).\n\nValidation at stage 1 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity data products. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the MYD21 data products are available from the MODIS Land Team Validation site (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/ValStatus.php?ProductID=MOD21).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* Three new CMG products are available in the MxD21 suite (MxD21C1/C2/C3).",

    "description": "WARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the NOAA-20 platform, also known as JPSS-1. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 FSR (Full Spectral Resolution) infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2100-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products with QC values of 0 (best), 1 (good), and 2 (don't use) which are provided for each variable.  Specific QC accepts profile level from the top of the atmosphere down to the level where the QC determines that it is still good. Below this level, the data is rejected.\n\n",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999).

With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005).

With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available.

The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other.

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSA5ND) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-12 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period.

The uncertainty of the SIF estimates was also quantified and is provided. Validation of the harmonized product showed that it retained high spatial and temporal consistency with the original SCIAMACHY and GOME-2 SIF retrievals and had good correlations with independent airborne and ground-based SIF measurements.

    "description": "WARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the NOAA-20 platform, also known as JPSS-1. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 FSR (Full Spectral Resolution) infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2100-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products with QC values of 0 (best), 1 (good), and 2 (don't use) which are provided for each variable. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables.\n\n",

    "title": "TOVS GLA MONTHLY GRIDS from NOAA-10 V01 (TOVSAMNG) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMNG) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-10 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are 6 level 3 data product files, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods include daily, 5 day (pentad) and monthly, with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

    "description": "The ASTER Global Water Bodies Database (ASTWBD) Version 1 data product provides global coverage of water bodies larger than 0.2 square kilometers at a spatial resolution of 1 arc second (approximately 30 meters) at the equator, along with associated elevation information. \r\n\r\nThe ASTWBD data product was created in conjunction with the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) Version 3 data product by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC) in Tokyo. The ASTER GDEM Version 3 data product was generated using ASTER Level 1A (https://doi.org/10.5067/ASTER/AST_L1A.003) scenes acquired between March 1, 2000, and November 30, 2013. The ASTWBD data product was then generated to correct elevation values of water body surfaces.\r\n\r\nTo generate the ASTWBD data product, water bodies were separated from land areas and then classified into three categories: ocean, river, or lake. Oceans and lakes have a flattened, constant elevation value. The effects of sea ice were manually removed from areas classified as oceans to better delineate ocean shorelines in high latitude areas. For lake waterbodies, the elevation for each lake was calculated from the perimeter elevation data using the mosaic image that covers the entire area of the lake. Rivers presented a unique challenge given that their elevations gradually step down from upstream to downstream; therefore, visual inspection and other manual detection methods were required. \r\n\r\nThe geographic coverage of the ASTWBD extends from 83°N to 83°S. Each tile is distributed in NetCDF format and referenced to the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84)/1996 Earth Gravitational Model (EGM96) geoid. Each ASTWBD_NC data product DEM file, which provides elevation information in meters. The corresponding ASTWBD_ATTNC file contains an attribute file with the water body classification information.",

The 3 arc second data was derived from the 1 arc second using sampling and averaging methods. SRTMGL3_NUMNC is used along with the SRTMGL3_NC data product and offers the number count in NetCDF.\r\n\r\nNASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) datasets result from a collaborative effort by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA - previously known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, or NIMA), as well as the participation of the German and Italian space agencies. The purpose of SRTM was to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth using radar interferometry. SRTM was a primary component of the payload on the Space Shuttle Endeavour during its STS-99 mission. Endeavour launched February 11, 2000 and ﬂew for 11 days. \r\n\r\nSRTM collected data in swaths, which extend from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 kilometers (km). These swaths are ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 60° North (N) and 56° South (S) latitude.

(1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods include daily, 5 day (pentad) and monthly, with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) Level 2 Near Real Time (NRT) Support Retrieval (AIRS-only) product (AIRS2SUP_NRT_7.0) differs from the routine product (AIRS2SUP_7.0) in four ways to meet the three hour latency requirements of the Land Atmosphere NRT Capability Earth Observing System (LANCE): (1) The NRT granules are produced without previous or subsequent granules if those granules are not available within 5 minutes, (2) the predictive ephemeris/attitude data are used rather than the definitive ephemeris/attitude, (3) if the forecast surface pressure is unavailable, a surface climatology is used, and (4) no ice cloud properties retrievals are performed. The consequences of these differences are described in the AIRS Near Real Time (NRT) data products document. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is product produced using AIRS IR only because the radiometric noise in several AMSU channels started to increase significantly (since June 2007). The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product, plus intermediate outputs (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. \n\nAn AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 scanlines. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

Each product delivery includes two Hierarchical Data Format - Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) files: one for the VNIR, and the other for the SWIR. They are distinguished from one another by a one-second difference in the production time that appears as part of the file name. \r\n\r\n ASTER Level 2 data requests for observations that occurred after May 27, 2020 will resort back to using the climatology ozone input. Additional information can be found in the ASTER L2 Processing Options Update (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/news/aster-l2-processing-options-update/).\r\n\r\nStarting June 23, 2021, radiometric calibration coefficient Version 5 (RCC V5) will be applied to newly observed ASTER data and archived ASTER data products. Details regarding RCC V5 are described in the following journal article.\r\n\r\nTsuchida, S., Yamamoto, H., Kouyama, T., Obata, K., Sakuma, F., Tachikawa, T., Kamei, A., Arai, K., Czapla-Myers, J.S., Biggar, S.F., and Thome, K.J., 2020, Radiometric Degradation Curves for the ASTER VNIR Processing Using Vicarious and Lunar Calibrations: Remote Sensing, v. 12, no. 3, at https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030427.\r\n\r\nAs of December 15, 2021, the LP DAAC has implemented changes to ASTER PGE Version 3.4, which will affect all ASTER Level 2 on-demand products.  Changes include:\r\n•\tAura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has been added as one of the ancillary ozone inputs for any observations made after May 27, 2020.  The sequence of fallbacks for ozone will remain the same.\r\n•\tToolkit has been updated from Version 5.2.17 to 5.2.20.  Users may notice minor differences between the two versions.  Differences may include minuscule changes in digital numbers around the peripheral of the granule and boundaries of a cloud for Surface Reflectance and Surface Radiance (AST07 and AST09) QA Data Plane depending on the Operating System and libraries being used by the user to process the data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Climatology, which is one of the inputs for Ozone and Moisture, Temperature and Pressures (MTP) will be removed from the Earthdata Order Form.  It has been observed that PGEs generated with Climatology as an input yield noticeable differences statistically during image and spectral analysis.  Climatology will continue to be used as the final default if neither of the first two selectable options are available for Ozone and MTP.

NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.\n\nThis dataset consists of a suite of historical trends in terrestrial hydrology over the conterminous United States estimated for the water years of 1980-2015 using the NCA-LDAS daily reanalysis. NCA-LDAS provides gridded daily outputs from the uncoupled Noah version 3.3 land surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution forced with NLDAS-2 meteorology (Xia et al., 2012), rescaled Climate Prediction Center precipitation, and assimilated satellite-based soil moisture, snow depth, and irrigation products (Jasinski et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2019).\n\nTrends in annual hydrologic indicators are reported using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test at p &lt; 0.1 significance. An additional precipitation trend field (annual total), with no significance test applied, is included for comparison purposes. Collectively, these fields represent the bulk of the results presented in Jasinski et al. (2019).",

    "description": "The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) is one of 10 sensors deployed in March of 2002 on board the polar-orbiting Envisat-1 environmental research satellite by the European Space Agency (ESA). The MERIS instrument is a moderate-resolution wide field-of-view push-broom imaging spectroradiometer capable of sensing in the 390 nm to 1040 nm spectral range. Being a programmable instrument, it had the unique capability of selectively adjusting the width and location of its 15 bands through ground command. The instrument has a 68.5-degree field of view and a swath width of 1150 meters, providing a global coverage every 3 days at 300 m resolution.  Communication with the Envisat-1 satellite was lost suddenly on the 8th of April, 2012, just weeks after celebrating its 10th year in orbit. All attempts to re-establish contact were unsuccessful, and the end of the mission was declared on May 9th, 2012.\r\n\r\nThe 4th reprocessing cycle, in 2020, has produced both the full-resolution and reduced-resolution L1 and L2 MERIS products. EN1_MDSI_MER_FRS_1P is the short-name for the MERIS Level-1 full resolution, full swath, geolocated and calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance product. This product contains the TOA upwelling spectral radiance measurements. The in-band reference irradiances for the 15 MERIS bands are computed by averaging the in-band solar irradiance for each pixel. Each pixel’s in-band solar irradiance is computed by integrating the reference solar spectrum with the band-pass of each pixel. The Level-1 product contains 22 data files: 15 files contain radiances for each band (one band per file) along with associated error estimates, and 7 annotation data files. It also includes a Manifest file that provides metadata information describing the product.",

    "description": "WARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the NOAA-20 platform, also known as JPSS-1. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 FSR (Full Spectral Resolution) infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2100-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products with QC values of 0 (best), 1 (good), and 2 (don't use) which are provided for each variable. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables.\n\n",

    "description": "The ASTER L2 Surface Emissivity is an on-demand product ((https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/996/ASTER_Earthdata_Search_Order_Instructions.pdf)) generated using the five thermal infrared (TIR) bands (acquired either during the day or night time) between 8 and 12 µm spectral range. It contains surface emissivity over the land at 90 meters spatial resolution. Estimates of surface emissivity were thus far only derived using surrogates such as land-cover type or vegetation index. \r\n\r\nThe Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm is used to derive both E (emissivity) and T (surface temperature). The main goals of the TES algorithm include: recovering accurate and precise emissivities for mineral substrates, and estimating accurate and precise surface temperatures especially over vegetation, water and snow.The TES algorithm is executed in the ASTER processing chain following generation of ASTER Level-2 Surface Radiance (TIR). The land-leaving radiance and down-welling irradiance vectors for each pixel are taken in account. Emissivity is estimated using the Normalized Emissivity Method (NEM), and is iteratively compensated for reflected sunlight. The emissivity spectrum is normalized using the average emissivity of each pixel. The minimum-maximum difference (MMD) of the normalized spectrum is calculated and estimates of the minimum emissivity derived through regression analysis. These estimates are used to scale the normalized emissivity and compensate for reflected skylight with the derived refinement of emissivity.\r\n\r\n ASTER Level 2 data requests for observations that occurred after May 27, 2020 will resort back to using the climatology ozone input. Additional information can be found in the ASTER L2 Processing Options Update (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/news/aster-l2-processing-options-update/).\r\n\r\nV003 data set release date: 2002-05-03\r\n\r\nStarting June 23, 2021, radiometric calibration coefficient Version 5 (RCC V5) will be applied to newly observed ASTER data and archived ASTER data products. Details regarding RCC V5 are described in the following journal article.\r\n\r\nTsuchida, S., Yamamoto, H., Kouyama, T., Obata, K., Sakuma, F., Tachikawa, T., Kamei, A., Arai, K., Czapla-Myers, J.S., Biggar, S.F., and Thome, K.J., 2020, Radiometric Degradation Curves for the ASTER VNIR Processing Using Vicarious and Lunar Calibrations: Remote Sensing, v. 12, no. 3, at https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12030427.\r\n\r\nAs of December 15, 2021, the LP DAAC has implemented changes to ASTER PGE Version 3.4, which will affect all ASTER Level 2 on-demand products.  Changes include:\r\n•\tAura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has been added as one of the ancillary ozone inputs for any observations made after May 27, 2020.  The sequence of fallbacks for ozone will remain the same.\r\n•\tToolkit has been updated from Version 5.2.17 to 5.2.20.  Users may notice minor differences between the two versions.  Differences may include minuscule changes in digital numbers around the peripheral of the granule and boundaries of a cloud for Surface Reflectance and Surface Radiance (AST07 and AST09) QA Data Plane depending on the Operating System and libraries being used by the user to process the data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Climatology, which is one of the inputs for Ozone and Moisture, Temperature and Pressures (MTP) will be removed from the Earthdata Order Form.  It has been observed that PGEs generated with Climatology as an input yield noticeable differences statistically during image and spectral analysis.  Climatology will continue to be used as the final default if neither of the first two selectable options are available for Ozone and MTP.  Users can check the OPERATIONALQUALITYFLAGEXPLANATION field in the metadata or the output file for atmospheric parameters that were applied\r\n",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999).

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSA5NF) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-9 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the\ndifference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. This collection contains a 5 day average.",

Landsat-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomalies were used to determine loss extent in each period. The drivers of mangrove loss were determined by examining land cover changes using a random forest machine learning technique that considered change from mangrove to wet soil, dry soil, and water at each loss pixel. A series of decision trees used several global-scale land-use datasets to identify the ultimate driver of the mangrove loss. Loss drivers include commodity production (agriculture, aquaculture), settlement, erosion, extreme climatic events, and non-productive conversion. Maps of loss extent per period, mangrove land cover changes, and loss drivers are provided for each of 39 mangrove holding nations.",

    "description": "The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) is one of 10 sensors deployed in March of 2002 on board the polar-orbiting Envisat-1 environmental research satellite by the European Space Agency (ESA). The MERIS instrument is a moderate-resolution wide field-of-view push-broom imaging spectroradiometer capable of sensing in the 390 nm to 1040 nm spectral range. Being a programmable instrument, it had the unique capability of selectively adjusting the width and location of its 15 bands through ground command. The instrument has a 68.5-degree field of view and a swath width of 1150 meters, providing a global coverage every 3 days at 300 m resolution.  Communication with the Envisat-1 satellite was lost suddenly on the 8th of April, 2012, just weeks after celebrating its 10th year in orbit. All attempts to re-establish contact were unsuccessful, and the end of the mission was declared on May 9th, 2012.\r\n\r\nThe 4th reprocessing cycle, in 2020, has produced both the full-resolution and reduced-resolution L1 and L2 MERIS products. EN1_MDSI_MER_FRS_2P is the short-name for the MERIS Level-2 full resolution, geophysical product for ocean, land, and atmosphere. This Level-2 product comes in a netCDF4 package that contains both instrument and science measurements, and a Manifest file that provides metadata information describing the product. Each Level-2 product contains 64 measurement files that break down thus: 13 files containing water-leaving reflectance, 13 files containing land surface reflectance and 13 files containing the TOA reflectance (for all bands except those dedicated to measuring atmospheric gas - M11 and M15), and several files containing additional measurements on ocean, land, and atmosphere parameters.",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 1.0 degree monthly dataset. \n\nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 VIC 1.0 degree monthly dataset. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 VIC 1.0 degree monthly data product, was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 VIC 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC Land Surface Model 4.1.2 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

    "title": "TOVS GLA 5 DAY GRIDS from TIROSN V01 (TOVSA5TN ) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This dataset (TOVSA5TN) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from TIROS-N and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period.  All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods include daily, 5 day (pentad) and monthly, with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid. This collection contains 5-day averages.",

The data were produced by CYGNSS investigators at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and the University Colorado at Boulder (CU), and derive from version 2.1 of the CYGNSS L1 SDR. The soil moisture algorithm uses collocated soil moisture retrievals from SMAP to calibrate CYGNSS observations from the same day. For a given location, a linear relationship between the SMAP soil moisture and CYGNSS reflectivity is determined and used to transform the CYGNSS observations into soil moisture. The data are archived in daily files in netCDF-4 format. Two soil moisture variables report the volumetric water content in units of cm3/cm3. The variable SM_subdaily includes up to four soil moisture estimates per day. Another variable SM_daily provides a daily average. The time series covers the period from March 2017 to present.",

The MERIS instrument is a moderate-resolution wide field-of-view push-broom imaging spectroradiometer capable of sensing in the 390 nm to 1040 nm spectral range. Being a programmable instrument, it had the unique capability of selectively adjusting the width and location of its 15 bands through ground command. The instrument has a 68.5-degree field of view and a swath width of 1150 meters, providing a global coverage every 3 days at 300 m resolution.  Communication with the Envisat-1 satellite was lost suddenly on the 8th of April, 2012, just weeks after celebrating its 10th year in orbit. All attempts to re-establish contact were unsuccessful, and the end of the mission was declared on May 9th, 2012.\r\n\r\nThe 4th reprocessing cycle, in 2020, has produced both the full-resolution and reduced-resolution L1 and L2 MERIS products. EN1_MDSI_MER_RR__2P is the short-name for the MERIS Level-2 reduced resolution, geophysical product for ocean, land, and atmosphere. This Level-2 product comes in a netCDF4 package that contains both instrument and science measurements, and a Manifest file that provides metadata information describing the product. Each Level-2 product contains 64 measurement files that break down thus: 13 files containing water-leaving reflectance, 13 files containing land surface reflectance and 13 files containing the TOA reflectance (for all bands except those dedicated to measuring atmospheric gas - M11 and M15), and several files containing additional measurements on ocean, land, and atmospheric parameters and annotation.",

    "description": "A new suite of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&amp;E) products are available in Collection 6.1. The MYD21 Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm differs from the algorithm of the MYD11 (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/myd11_l2.061) LST products, in that the MYD21 algorithm is based on the ASTER Temperature/Emissivity Separation (TES) technique, whereas the MYD11 uses the split-window technique. The MYD21 TES algorithm uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both the LST and spectral emissivity simultaneously from the MODIS thermal infrared bands 29, 31, and 32. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. \n\nThe MYD21C2 dataset is an 8-day composite LST product that uses an algorithm based on a simple averaging method. The algorithm calculates the average from all the cloud free MYD21A1D (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD21A1D.061) and MYD21A1N (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD21A1N.061) daily acquisitions from the 8-day period. Unlike the MOD21A1 data sets where the daytime and nighttime acquisitions are separate products, the MYD21A2 contains both daytime and nighttime acquisitions as separate Science Dataset (SDS) layers within a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file. The LST, Quality Control (QC), view zenith angle, and viewing time have separate day and night SDS layers, while the values for the MODIS emissivity bands 29, 31, and 32 are the average of both the nighttime and daytime acquisitions. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1399/MOD21_ATBD.pdf)).\n\nValidation at stage 1 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity data products. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the MYD21 data products are available from the MODIS Land Team Validation site (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/ValStatus.php?ProductID=MOD21).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* Three new CMG products are available in the MxD21 suite (MxD21C1/C2/C3).\n",

The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Full Spectral Resolution (FSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 FSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2000-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products with QC values of 0 (best), 1 (good), and 2 (don't use) which are provided for each variable. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables.\n",

    "description": "The 8-day Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/viirs) surface reflectance (VJ109A1) Version 2 composite product provides an estimate of land surface reflectance from the NOAA-20 VIIRS sensor for nine moderate resolution bands (M1 - M5, M7, M8, M10, M11) at nominal 1 kilometer resolution (~926 meter). The 1 kilometer dataset is derived through resampling the native 750 meter VIIRS resolution in the Level 2 input product. The data are corrected for atmospheric conditions such as the effects of molecular gases, including ozone and water vapor, and for the effects of atmospheric aerosols. Each pixel represents the best possible Level 2G observation during an 8-day period that is selected on the basis of high observation coverage, low sensor angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading. Included in the product along with the nine reflectance bands are day of year, reflectance band quality, control, reflectance state quality assurance, relative azimuth angle, sensor zenith angle, and solar zenith angle layers. \n\n",

    "description": "This data set provides the concentrations of soil microbial biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus at biome and global scales. The data were compiled from a comprehensive survey of publications from the late 1970s to 2012 and include 3,422 data points from 315 papers. These data are from soil samples collected primarily at 0-15 cm depth with some from 0-30 cm. In addition, data were compiled for soil microbial biomass concentrations from soil profile samples to depths of 100 cm. Sampling site latitude and longitude were available for the majority of the samples that enabled assembling additional soil properties, site characteristics, vegetation distributions, biomes, and long-term climate data from several global sources of soil, land-cover, and climate data. These site attributes are included with the microbial biomass data. This data set contains two *.csv files of the soil microbial biomass C, N, P data. The first provides all compiled results emphasizing the full spatial extent of the data, while the second is a subset that provides only data from a series of profile samples emphasizing the vertical distribution of microbial biomass concentrations.There is a companion file, also in .csv format, of the references for the surveyed publications. A reference_number relates the data to the respective publication.The concentrations of soil microbial biomass, in combination with other soil databases, were used to estimate the global storage of soil microbial biomass C and N in 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm soil profiles. These storage estimates were combined with a spatial map of 12 major biomes (boreal forest, temperate coniferous forest, temperate broadleaf forest, tropical and subtropical forests, mixed forest, grassland, shrub, tundra, desert, natural wetland, cropland, and pasture) at 0.05-degree by 0.5-degree spatial resolution. The biome map and six estimates of C and N storage and C:N ration in soil microbial biomass are provided in a single netCDF format file. ",

DSR is incident solar radiation over land surfaces in the shortwave spectrum (300-4,000 nanometers) and is an important variable in land-surface models that address a variety of scientific and application issues. The MCD18 products are based on a prototyping algorithm that uses multi-temporal signatures of MODIS data to derive surface reflectance and then calculate incident DSR using the look-up table (LUT) approach. The LUTs consider different types of loadings of aerosols and clouds at a variety of illumination/viewing geometry. Global DSR products are generated from MODIS and geostationary satellite data. Additional details regarding the methodology used to create the data are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/106/MCD18_ATBD.pdf)).\n\nProvided in the MOD18C1 product are layers for instantaneous DSR array for each individual MODIS overpass and 3-hour DSR array along with a View Zenith Angle layer.\n\nValidation at stage 1 ( https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Surface Radiation products.

Two Phase 2 model experiments were run.  First, a set of selected  biogeochemical models and coupled biogeochemical-biogeographical models were run from 1895 to 1993 to compare model responses to the historical time series and current ecosystem biogeochemistry.  Second, these same models were run on the projected 1994 to 2100 data to compare their ecological responses to transient scenarios of climate and atmospheric CO2 change. Model runs were performed for daily, monthly, and annual gridded data sets. The output of the annual model runs in VEMAP grid format are contained in this data set.

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 Catchment 1.0 degree monthly dataset. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 monthly 1.0 degree product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 3-hourly data simulated with the Catchment-F2.5 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

    "description": "WARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Full Spectral Resolution (FSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 FSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2000-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products with QC values of 0 (best), 1 (good), and 2 (don't use) which are provided for each variable. Specific QC accepts profile level from the top of the atmosphere down to the level where the QC determines that it is still good. Below this level, the data is rejected.\n\n",

    "description": "This Near Real-Time (NRT) data set corresponds to the standard SMAP L2 Radiometer Half-Orbit 36 km EASE-Grid Soil Moisture (SPL2SMP) product. The data provide estimates of global land surface conditions measured by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) passive microwave radiometer, the SMAP L-band radiometer. These Near Real-Time data are available within three hours of satellite observation. The data are created using the latest available ancillary data and spacecraft and antenna attitude data to reduce latency. The SMAP satellite orbits Earth every two to three days, providing half-orbit, ascending and descending, coverage from 86.4°S to 86.4°N in swaths 1000 km across. Data are stored for approximately two to three weeks. Thus, at any given time, users have access to at least fourteen consecutive days of Near Real-Time data through the NSIDC DAAC.  Users deciding between the NRT and standard SMAP products should consider the immediacy of their needs versus the quality of the data required. Near real-time data are provided for operational needs whereas standard products meet the quality needs of scientific research. If latency is not a primary concern, users are encouraged to use the standard science product SPL2SMP (&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5067/LPJ8F0TAK6E0\"&gt;https://doi.org/10.5067/LPJ8F0TAK6E0&lt;/a&gt;).",

The updated software provides digital elevation extraction and orthorectification from ASTER L1B input data without needing to enter ground control points or depending on external global DEMs at 30-arc-second resolution (GTOPO30). It utilizes the ephemeris and attitude data derived from both the ASTER instrument and the Terra spacecraft platform. The outputs are geoid height-corrected and waterbodies are automatically detected in this version. Users will notice differences between AST14DEM, AST14DMO, and AST14OTH products ordered before January 2021 (generated with SILCAST V1) and those generated with the updated version of the production software (version 3.0). Differences may include slight elevation changes over different surface types, including waterbodies. Differences have also been observed over cloudy portions of ASTER scenes.

    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECOSTRESS Swath Cloud Mask Instantaneous L2 Global 70 m (ECO_L2_CLOUD) Version 2 data product is derived using a single-channel Bayesian cloud threshold with a look-up-table (LUT) approach. The ECOSTRESS Level 2 cloud product provides a cloud mask that can be used to determine cloud cover for accurate land surface temperature and evapotranspiration estimation. The corresponding ECO_L1B_GEO (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO_L1B_GEO.002) data product is required to georeference the ECO_L2_CLOUD data product.\r\n \r\nThe ECO_L2_CLOUD Version 2 data product contains two cloud mask layers: Brightness temperature LUT test and Final cloud mask. Information on how to interpret the bit fields in the cloud mask is provided in Table 7 of the User Guide.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_MSU_NOAA11_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day of the retrieval period which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. This CMG product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. \r\n\r\nMCD43C1 provides the three model weighting parameters (isotropic, volumetric, and geometric) used to derive the Albedo (MCD43C3) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43C3.006) and BRDF (MCD43C4) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43C4.006) products. Each model parameter is available as a separate layer for MODIS spectral bands 1 through 7 as well as the visible, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave bands.

Collection 5 used only four observations per day.\r\n*\tThe MCD43 products use L2G-lite surface reflectance as input.\r\n*\tWhen there are insufficient high quality reflectances, a database with archetypal BRDF parameters is used to supplement the observational data and perform a lower quality magnitude inversion. This database is continually updated with the latest full inversion retrieval for each pixel.\r\n*\tCMG Albedo is estimated using all the clear-sky observations within the 1,000 m grid for MCD43C as opposed to aggregating from the 500 m albedo.\r\n\r\nImportant Quality Information\r\nThe incorrect representation of the aerosol quantities (low average high) in the C6 MYD09 and MOD09 surface reflectance products may have impacted down stream products particularly over arid bright surfaces (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD09&amp;caseNum=PM_MOD09_20010&amp;caseLocation=cases_data&amp;type=C6). This (and a few other issues) have been corrected for C6.1. Therefore users should avoid substantive use of the C6 MCD43 products and wait for the C6.1 products. In any event, users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in MCD43A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QAs provided as part of the MCD43A1, 3, and 4 products.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset provides the complete catalog of point cloud data collected during LiDAR surveys over selected forest research sites across the Amazon rainforest in Brazil between 2008 and 2018 for the Sustainable Landscapes Brazil Project. Flight lines were selected to overfly key field research sites in the Brazilian states of Acre, Amazonas, Bahia, Goias, Mato Grosso, Para, Rondonia, Santa Catarina, and Sao Paulo. The point clouds have been georeferenced, noise-filtered, and corrected for misalignment of overlapping flight lines. They are provided in 1 km2 tiles. The data were collected to measure forest canopy structure across Amazonian landscapes to monitor the effects of selective logging on forest biomass and carbon balance, and forest recovery over time.",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration.

Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias.

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product plus intermediate output (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 pressure levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than in the Standard Product profiles. The horizontal resolution is 50 km. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance, or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. \n\nAn AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

The L4 RZSM data have the same spatial resolution (3-arcsecs or ~100 m), and the same temporal coverage (generally Fall 2012 through Fall 2015), as the underlying L2/3 RZSM data. The L4 RZSM data were produced by the integration of the Level 2/3 product and other ancillary information into the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM).

The purpose of SRTM was to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth using radar interferometry. SRTM was a primary component of the payload on the Space Shuttle Endeavour during its STS-99 mission. Endeavour launched February 11, 2000 and ﬂew for 11 days.\r\n\r\nEach SRTMGL1 data tile contains a mosaic and blending of elevations generated by averaging all \"data takes\" that fall within that tile. These elevation files use the extension “.HGT”, meaning height (such as N37W105.SRTMGL1.HGT). The primary goal of creating the Version 3 data was to eliminate voids that were present in earlier versions of SRTM data. In areas with limited data, existing topographical data were used to supplement the SRTM data to fill the voids. The source of each elevation pixel is identified in the corresponding SRTMGL1N (https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMGL1N.003) product (such as N37W105.SRTMGL1N.NUM).\r\n\r\nSRTM collected data in swaths, which extend from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 kilometers (km). These swaths are ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 60° N and 56° S latitude. This accounts for about 80% of Earth’s total landmass. \r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions \r\n* Voids in the Version 3.0 products have been filled with ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Version 2.0, the Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010), and the National Elevation Dataset (NED).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "ISLSCP II Global Population of the World",
    "description": "Global Population of the World (GPW) translates census population data to a latitude-longitude grid so that population data may be used in cross-disciplinary studies. There are three data files with this data set for the reference years 1990 and 1995. Over 127,000 administrative units and population counts were collected and integrated from various sources to create the gridded data. In brief, GPW was created using the following steps:    * Population data were estimated for the product reference years, 1990 and 1995, either by the data source or by interpolating or extrapolating the given estimates for other years.    * Additional population estimates were created by adjusting the source population data to match UN national population estimates for the reference years.    * Borders and coastlines of the spatial data were matched to the Digital Chart of the World where appropriate and lakes from the Digital Chart of the World were added.    * The resulting data were then transformed into grids of UN-adjusted and unadjusted population counts for the reference years.    * Grids containing the area of administrative boundary data in each cell (net of lakes) were created and used with the count grids to produce population densities.As with any global data set based on multiple data sources, the spatial and attribute precision of GPW is variable. The level of detail and accuracy, both in time and space, vary among the countries for which data were obtained.",

    "title": "ISLSCP II Historical Croplands Cover, 1700-1992",
    "description": "The Historical Croplands Cover data set was developed to understand the consequences of historical changes in land use and land cover for ecosystem goods and services. In particular, this data set can be used to study how global changes in cultivated area has influenced climate, biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, etc. This data set can be used directly within spatially-explicit climate and biogeochemical models.This is a gridded data set describing the fraction of each grid cell in the globe that is occupied by cultivated land from 1700 to 1992. Data layers are provided for every 50 years from 1700 to 1850, every 10 years from 1850 to 1980, and every year from 1986 to 1992.There are two sources of global land cover/land use data. The most recent estimates are derived from satellite measurements, and are available in a spatially-explicit fashion for roughly the last 30 years. The other estimate is based on ground-based sources such as census statistics, land surveys, estimates by historical geographers, etc. These land inventory data are only available at the scale of political units, but have the advantage of being historical. Ramankutty and Foley (1998) derived a spatially-explicit data set of croplands in 1992 by synthesizing remotely-sensed land cover data with contemporary land inventory data. Furthermore, Ramankutty and Foley (1999) extended this data set into the past (back to 1700) using historical land inventory data.The data set should only be used for continental-to-global scale analysis and modeling. The data set captures the broad patterns of cropland change over history, but not necessarily the fine details at local to regional scales - please check the data quality before using it at fine spatial scales. The quality of historical data for the Russian Federation is poor. The quality of data prior to 1850 is poor -- only continental-scale historical data were used for that period. ",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_MSU_NOAA07_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "The VIIRS/NPP Thermal Anomalies/Fire 6-Min L2 Swath 750m NRT product is based on the MODIS C6 Fire algorithm. The input to the Active Fires production are Level-1B moderate-resolution reflective band M7, and emissive bands M13 and M15. The fire algorithm first calculates bands M13, M15 brightness temperature (BT) statistics for a group of background pixels adjacent to each potential fire pixel. These statistics are used to set thresholds for several contextual fire detection tests. There is also an absolute fire detection test based on a pre-set M13 BT threshold. If the results of the absolute and relative fire detection tests meet certain criteria, the pixel is labeled as fire. The designation of a pixel as fire from the results of the BT threshold tests may be overridden under sun glint conditions or if too few pixels were used to calculate the background statistics.\n\nThe VNP14_NRT product contains several pieces of information for each fire pixel: pixel coordinates, latitude and longitude, pixel M7 reflectance, background M7 reflectance, pixel M13 and M15 BT, background M13 and M15 BT, mean background BT difference, background M13, M15, and BT difference mean absolute deviation, fire radiative power, number of adjacent cloud pixels, number of adjacent water pixels, background window size, number of valid background pixels, detection confidence, land pixel flag, background M7 reflectance, and reflectance mean absolute deviation.\n\nThe product provides day and nighttime active fire detection over land and water (from gas flares). The VNP14 product provides fire data continuity with NASA's EOS MODIS 1 km fire product. \n\nFor more information visit University of Maryland VIIRS Active Fire Web page at http://viirsfire.geog.umd.edu/",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 1.0 degree 3-hourly dataset. \n\nThe 3-hourly data product was simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

    "description": "The Historical Land Cover and Land Use data set was developed to provide the global change community with historical land use estimates. The data set describes historical land use changes over a 300-year historical period (1700-1990).Testing against historical data is an important step for validating integrated models of global environmental change. Owing to long time lags in the climate and biogeochemical systems, these models should aim to simulate the land use dynamics for long periods, i.e., spanning decades to centuries. Developing such models requires an understanding of past and current trends and is therefore strongly data dependent. For this purpose, a historical database of the global environment has been developed: HYDE. Historical statistical inventories on agricultural land (census data, tax records, land surveys, etc) and different spatial analysis techniques were used to create a geographically-explicit data set of land use change, with a regular time interval. The data set can be used to test integrated models of global change. Continental-scale historical data were used for that period. ",

The SRDB holds results of field studies of soil respiration from around the globe. A total of 4,115 records from 1,036 studies were selected from SRDB-V5. SRDB-V5 features more soil respiration data published in Russian and Chinese scientific literature for better global spatio-temporal coverage and improved global climate-space representation. These soil respiration records were combined with global meteorological, land cover, and topographic data and then evaluated with variable selection using random forests. The standard deviation and coefficient of variation of Rs are included and were also derived from the same model. Global heterotrophic respiration was calculated from Rs estimates. The data are produced in part from SRDB-V5 inputs that cover the period 1961-2016.",

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 VIC 1.0 degree 3-hourly dataset. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 VIC 1.0 degree 3-hourly data product was simulated with the VIC Land Surface Model 4.1.2 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

The LVIS lidar instrument was flown over study sites in Lope, Mondah/Akanda, Pongara, Rabi, and Mabouni from February to March 2016. Derived canopy cover, canopy heights, bare ground elevation, plant area index (PAI), and foliage height diversity (FHD), and respective uncertainties are provided at a 25 m resolution for each of the five study sites. Aboveground biomass density (AGBD) and uncertainty were modeled at 50 m and 100 m resolutions for the Lope, Mondah, and Mabounie sites using field inventory data and waveform height and cover metrics. Lidar grid cell data collection statistics (i.e., number of shots and flight lines) and a data mask are also included. This research leverages high-quality forest inventory datasets collected during the AfriSAR campaign for one of the least studied and most unique forest ecosystems in the world.",

The VJ121A1 algorithm sorts through all these observations for each cell and estimates the final LST value as an average from all cloud-free observations that have good LST accuracies. The daytime average is weighted by the observation coverage for that cell. Only observations having observation coverage more than a certain threshold (15%) are considered for this averaging. The 1 kilometer dataset is derived through resampling the native 750 meter VIIRS resolution in the input product.\r\n\r\nThe VJ121A1D product is developed synergistically with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST&amp;E Version 6.1 product (MOD21A1D) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21A1D.061)) using the same input atmospheric products and algorithmic approach. The overall objective for NASA VIIRS products is to ensure the algorithms and products are compatible with the MODIS Terra and Aqua algorithms to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1332/VNP21_ATBD_V1.pdf). \r\n\r\nThe VJ121A1D product contains seven Science Datasets (SDS): LST, quality control, emissivity for bands M14, M15, and M16, view zenith angle, and time of observation.

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 Catchment 1.0 degree 3-hourly dataset. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 3 hourly 1.0 degree product was simulated with the Catchment-F2.5 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

Global gridded long-term daily GPP was derived using the optimized LUE, Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS3g) canopy fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, (MERRA-2) meteorological information.

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration.

Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias.

    "description": "The objective of this limited edition data collection is to examine products generated by the Climate Heritage AIRS Retrieval Technique (CHART) algorithm to analyze Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite).  The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; outgoing longwave radiation (OLR); and an infrared-based precipitation estimate.\n\n\nThe monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the specific quality control (QC) methodology to form a level-2 daily gridded product. Specific QC is defined per retrieved geophysical parameter at a given level within a profile. It accepts profile level data from the top of the atmosphere down to the level where the QC algorithm determines that the retrieval is good. Below this level, the data is rejected. This is the same methodology used by the AIRS Version 6 processing system. The daily level-3 gridded products are averaged to create the monthly average. \n\n\nThe CHART system was designed to serve as a seamless follow on to the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AIRS/AMSU) instrument processing system. For comparison, the AIRS/AMSU data collection from AIRX3STM contains similar meteorological information to this CHART data collection.",

    "description": "The NOAA-20 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&amp;E) Version 2 swath product (VJ121) is produced daily in 6-minute temporal increments of satellite acquisition. The VJ121 product uses a physics-based algorithm to dynamically retrieve both the LST and emissivity simultaneously for VIIRS thermal infrared bands M14 (8.55 µm), M15 (10.76 µm), and M16 (12 µm) at a spatial resolution of 750 meters.\r\n\r\nThe VJ121 product is developed synergistically with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST&amp;E Version 6.1 product (MOD21) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21.061) using the same input atmospheric products and algorithmic approach based on the ASTER Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) technique. The TES algorithm is combined with an improved Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction scheme to stabilize the retrieval during very warm and humid conditions. The overall objective for NASA VIIRS products is to ensure the algorithms and products are compatible with the MODIS Terra and Aqua algorithms to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 2 (L2) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1332/VNP21_ATBD_V1.pdf).\r\n\r\nProvided in the VJ121 product are layers for LST, quality control, emissivity for bands M14, M15, and M16, LST&amp;E errors, view angle, ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset (GED), Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV), ocean-land mask, latitude, and longitude.

    "description": "This data set provides a map of wetland extent, vegetation type, and dual-season flooding state of the entire lowland Amazon basin. The map was derived from mosaics of Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for the period October-November 1995 and May-July 1996. The images are from the original JERS-1 SAR Global Rain Forest Mapping Project (GRFM) (Rosenqvist et al., 2000). Hess et al. (2003; 2012) mapped and validated wetland extent, vegetative cover, and flooding state for an 18 degree X 8 degree portion of the central Amazon using dual-season GRFM mosaics. This study extends the previous wetlands mapping to report the first validated estimate of wetland extent, cover, and flooding for the lowland Amazon basin. A wetlands mask was created by segmentation of the mosaics and clustering of the resulting polygons; a rules set was then applied to classify wetland areas into five land cover classes and two flooding classes using dual-season backscattering values. The mapped wetland area of 8.4 X 105 km2 is equivalent to 14% of the total basin area (5.83 X 106 km2) and 17% of the lowland basin (5.06 X 106 km2). The mapped flooding extent is representative of average high- and low-flood conditions for latitudes north of 6 degrees S; flooding conditions were less well captured for the southern part of the basin.",

    "title": "SnowEx Meteorological Station Measurements from Grand Mesa, CO V001",
    "description": "This dataset contains meteorological data collected as part of the ongoing the NASA SnowEx mission, from five meteorological stations installed between 2016-2017 in Grand Mesa, Colorado, to provide supporting data for SnowEx field campaigns and forcing data for modeling. Each station collects a suite of meteorological data at a fixed geographic point, from varying heights above and below the surface elevation. Measured data include: air temperature, relative humidity, long and shortwave solar radiation, barometric pressure, soil moisture and temperature, and derived snow depth. The temporal data coverage varies between each station, but spans October 2016 to August 2022.   \n\n\nThe dataset(s) contain air temperature and relative humidity (10ft and 20ft levels),  4-component radiation (shortwave, longwave), barometric pressure, soil-moisture and temperature (three depths), and a snow-depth product. Data coverage varies for each met station, but spans the time period of October 2016 – August, 2022. The data frequency is hourly and times are in UTC. The data is monotonic (no duplicate or mis-orderd timestamps) and steps have been taken to remove erroneous data. Periods of missing data are filled with NaN values. The scripts used to process raw data into the current format  are available on the github page (https://github.com/wrudisill/GrandMesaMetData/blob/main/process_data_initial.py).",

    "description": "The NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&amp;E) Day Version 2 product (VNP21A1D) is compiled daily from daytime Level 2 Gridded (L2G) intermediate products.  \r\n\r\nThe L2G process maps the daily (VNP21) (https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP21.002) swath granules onto a sinusoidal MODIS grid and stores all observations overlapping a gridded cell for a given day. The VNP21A1 algorithm sorts through all these observations for each cell and estimates the final LST value as an average from all cloud-free observations that have good LST accuracies. The daytime average is weighted by the observation coverage for that cell. Only observations having observation coverage more than a certain threshold (15%) are considered for this averaging. The 1 kilometer dataset is derived through resampling the native 750 meter VIIRS resolution in the input product.\r\n\r\nThe VNP21A1D product is developed synergistically with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST&amp;E Version 6.1 product (MOD21A1D) (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD21A1D.061)) using the same input atmospheric products and algorithmic approach. The overall objective for NASA VIIRS products is to ensure the algorithms and products are compatible with the MODIS Terra and Aqua algorithms to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1332/VNP21_ATBD_V1.pdf). VIIRS LST&amp;E products are available 2 months after acquisition due to latency of data inputs.\r\n\r\nThe VNP21A1D product contains seven Science Datasets (SDS): LST, quality control, emissivity for bands M14, M15, and M16, view zenith angle, and time of observation. A low-resolution browse image for LST is also available for each VNP21A1D granule.\r\n",

    "description": "The NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Albedo Model Parameters Daily Global 0.05 Degree Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) Version 1 product (VNP43C1) is derived from the 30 arc second CMG VNP43D Version 1 product suite. VNP43C1 is generated daily from all available high-quality reflectance data over a 16-day moving window emphasizing the ninth day of the retrieval period, which is reflected in the Julian date in the filename. VNP43C1 supplies the weighting parameters associated with the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal BRDF model that best describes the anisotropy of each pixel, which is used to produce the VNP43C3 Albedo and VNP43C4 Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) products. The highest quality full inversion values are used for the temporal fitting effort and supplemented with lower quality pixels, spatial fitting, and spatial smoothing as needed. The status of each pixel can be found in the ancillary layers. Users are encouraged to assess the quality information before using the BRDF/Albedo data. This 0.05 degree (5,600 meters at the equator) CMG product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. \r\n\r\nThe VNP43C1 product includes 39 layers containing the three parameters (fiso, fvol, and fgeo) for the VIIRS Day/Night band (DNB), moderate resolution bands M1 through M5, M7, M8, M10, and M11, as well as the shortwave band, visible band, and near-infrared (NIR) broadbands. Along with the parameter data for the 13 bands are five ancillary layers for uncertainty, quality, local solar noon, percent finer resolution inputs, and snow cover. A low-resolution browse is also provided showing BRDF/Albedo parameters for bands M5, M4, and M3 as a red, green, blue (RGB) image in JPEG format.\r\n",

    "title": "ISLSCP II Ecosystem Rooting Depths",
    "description": "The goal of this study was to predict the global distribution of plant rooting depths based on data about global aboveground vegetation structure and climate. Vertical root distributions influence the fluxes of water, carbon, and soil nutrients and the distribution and activities of soil fauna. Roots transport nutrients and water upwards, but they are also pathways for carbon and nutrient transport into deeper soil layers and for deep water infiltration. Roots also affect the weathering rates of soil minerals. For calculating such processes on a global scale, data on vertical root distributions are needed as inputs to global biogeochemistry and vegetation models. In the Project for Intercomparison of Land Surface Parameterization Schemes (PILPS), rooting depth and vertical soil characteristics were the most important factors explaining scatter for simulated transpiration among 14 land-surface models. Recently, the Terrestrial Observation Panel for Climate of the Global Climate Observation System (GCOS) identified the 95% rooting depth as a key variable needed to quantify the interactions between the climate, soil, and plants, stating that the main challenge was to find the correlation between rooting depth and soil and climate features (GCOS/GTOS Terrestrial Observation Panel for Climate 1997). In response to this challenge, a data set of vertical rooting depths was collected from the literature in order to construct maps of global ecosystem rooting depths.The parameters included in these data sets are estimates for the soil depths containing 50% and 95% of all roots, termed 50% and 95% rooting depths (D50 and D95, respectively). Together, these variables can be used to calculate estimates for vertical root distributions, using a logistic equation provided in this documentation. The data represent mean ecosystem rooting depths for 1 by 1 degree grid cells. Related data sets: The ORNL DAAC offers related data sets by Jackson et al. (2003), Gordon and Jackson (2003), Schenk and Jackson (2003), and Gill and Jackson (2003).This data set is one of the products of the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP II) data collection which contains 50 global time series data sets for the ten-year period 1986 to 1995. Selected data sets span even longer periods. ISLSCP II is a consistent collection of data sets that were compiled from existing data sources and algorithms, and were designed to satisfy the needs of modelers and investigators of the global carbon, water and energy cycle. The data were acquired from a number of U.S. and international agencies, universities, and institutions. The global data sets were mapped at consistent spatial (1, 0.5 and 0.25 degrees) and temporal (monthly, with meteorological data at finer (e.g., 3-hour)) resolutions and reformatted into a common ASCII format. The data and documentation have undergone two peer reviews.ISLSCP is one of several projects of Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) [http://www.gewex.org/] and has the lead role in addressing land-atmosphere interactions -- process modeling, data retrieval algorithms, field experiment design and execution, and the development of global data sets.",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other.

    "description": "This data set contains in-situ soil moisture profile and soil temperature data collected at 320-minute intervals at SoilSCAPE (Soil moisture Sensing Controller and oPtimal Estimator) project sites in the United States and New Zealand. SoilSCAPE used wireless sensor technology to acquire high temporal resolution soil moisture and temperature data at up to 812 sites over varying durations since December 2021. At its maximum, the network consisted of over 160 wireless sensor installations (nodes), with a range of 6 to 8 nodes per site.Each SoilSCAPE site contains multiple wireless end-devices (EDs). Each ED supports up to 4 soil moisture probes  (METER Teros-12), typically installed at 5, 10, 20, and 30 cm below the surface.Soil conditions (e.g., hard soil or rocks) may have limited sensor placement. The data enables estimation of local-scale soil moisture at high temporal resolution and validation of remote sensing estimates of soil moisture at regional (airborne, e.g. NASA's Airborne Microwave Observation of Subcanopy and Subsurface Mission - AirMOSS) and national (spaceborne, e.g. NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive - SMAP) scales.",

This product is designed after the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Thermal Anomalies and Fire data products to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. This data product can enable users to understand the location and intensity of fire events as well as identifying thermal anomalies. \r\n\r\nThe VNP14 product includes 31 science dataset layers to analyze key factors in fire detection, including atmospheric conditions (e.g., atmospheric reflectance, solar zenith angle, brightness temperature) and fuel type for the event. The fire mask layer in the VNP14 product is the primary layer and can be used to identify fires and other thermal anomalies such as volcanoes. In addition to the fire mask, brightness temperature is provided for VIIRS channels M5, M7, M11, M13, M15, and M16.  \r\n\r\nEach swath of data is approximately 3,060 kilometers along track (long) and 3,060 kilometers across track (wide).

The VNP43 data products are designed to promote the continuity of NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo data product suite.\r\n\r\nThe VNP43 algorithm uses the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model, with the three kernel weights from VNP43DNBA1 to reconstruct surface anisotropic effects, correcting the directional reflectance to a common view geometry (VNP43DNBA4), while also computing integrated black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon and white-sky albedo (WSA) (VNP43DNBA3). Researchers can use the BRDF model parameters with a simple polynomial to obtain black-sky albedo at any solar illumination angle. Likewise, both the BSA and WSA Science Dataset (SDS) layers can be used with a simple polynomial to manually estimate instantaneous actual albedo (blue-sky albedo). Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).\r\n\r\nThe VNP43DNBA1 data product provides two SDS layers for mandatory quality and model parameters representing fiso, fvol, and fgeo for the VIIRS DNB.

Predictions of gridded SOC and uncertainty based on multiple bulk density (BD) pedotransfer functions (PFTs) are also included. The second set of gridded SOC estimates, for the period 2009-2011, were derived from two fully independent validation field datasets from across both countries. Note that the same environmental variables and modeling approach used for the first set of estimates were applied to the second set to assess the models' sensitivity to multiple SOC data sources.

The model simulations resulted from a synthesis effort organized by the Permafrost Carbon Network to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the carbon cycle in permafrost regions in the high northern latitudes.  The model teams used different historical input weather data, but most used driver data developed by the Climate Research Unit - National Centers for Environmental Prediction (CRUNCEP) as modified for the Multiscale Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP).  The teams scaled the driver data for the projections using output from global climate models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The synthesis evaluated the terrestrial carbon cycle in the modern era and projected future emissions of carbon under two climate warming scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP45 and RCP85) from CMIP5.

The daily NEE estimates are generally available from October 2012 through October 2014, although the exact time ranges vary by site. The AirMOSS L4 daily NEE were produced by the Ecosystem Demography Biosphere Model (ED2) augmented by the AirMOSS-derived L2/3 root zone soil moisture data as an additional input. The AirMOSS soil moisture data were used to estimate the sensitivity of carbon fluxes to soil moisture and to diagnose and improve estimation and prediction of NEE by constraining the model's predictions of soil moisture and its impact on above- and below-ground fluxes.",

The focus sites are in the following states: Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. These scenes were selected to represent a wide range of forest ecosystems, which ensured that a diversity of forest type groups and forest change processes (e.g., harvest, fire, insects, and urbanization) were included. Disturbance history was derived from a Landsat time-series for each site. Each disturbance is represented by year of detection, duration, and magnitude. The cause of the disturbance was not identified. Forest biomass was measured at field plots within each of the six sites and combined with airborne LiDAR data from each site to create land validation maps. Site biomass at 30-m resolution was estimated by developing Random Forest models that include site disturbance history with the land validation maps.",

    "title": "ISLSCP II C4 Vegetation Percentage",
    "description": "The photosynthetic composition (C3 or C4) of vegetation on the land surface is essential for accurate simulations of biosphere-atmosphere exchanges of carbon, water, and energy. C3 and C4 plants have different responses to light, temperature, CO2, and nitrogen; they also differ in physiological functions like stomatal conductance and isotope fractionation. A fine-scale distribution of these plant types is essential for earth science modeling.The C4 percentage is determined from data sets that describe the continuous distribution of plant growth forms (i.e., the percent of a grid cell covered by herbaceous or woody vegetation), climate classifications, the fraction of a grid cell covered in croplands, and national crop type harvest area statistics. The staff from the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II have made the original data set consistent with the ISLSCP-2 land/water mask. This data set contains a single file in ArcInfo ASCIIGRID format.This data set is one of the products of the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP II) data collection which contains 50 global time series data sets for the ten-year period 1986 to 1995. Selected data sets span even longer periods. ISLSCP II is a consistent collection of data sets that were compiled from existing data sources and algorithms, and were designed to satisfy the needs of modelers and investigators of the global carbon, water and energy cycle. The data were acquired from a number of U.S. and international agencies, universities, and institutions. The global data sets were mapped at consistent spatial (1, 0.5 and 0.25 degrees) and temporal (monthly, with meteorological data at finer (e.g., 3-hour)) resolutions and reformatted into a common ASCII format. The data and documentation have undergone two peer reviews.ISLSCP is one of several projects of Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) [http://www.gewex.org/] and has the lead role in addressing land-atmosphere interactions -- process modeling, data retrieval algorithms, field experiment design and execution, and the development of global data sets.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_HIRS3_AM_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) is also retrieved using EPIC 340 and 388 nm channels. The retrieval algorithm assumes a quasi-Gaussian aerosol vertical profile shape and retrieves aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the height at which the aerosol extinction peaks (e.g., AOCH). Cloud mask is conducted through the spatial variability tests at 443 and 551 nm and the brightness tests with the prescribed threshold of TOA reflectance at 443 and 680 nm for land and 443, 680, and 780 nm over water. The water pixels with a sun glint angle smaller than 30 are screened out. AOD is then retrieved from EPIC atmospheric window channel 443 nm, and the AOCH is derived subsequently based on the ratios of oxygen A and B bands to their corresponding neighboring continuum bands (764/780 nm and 688/680 nm). The surface reflectance for water surface comes from the GOME-2 Lambert-equivalent reflectivity (LER) product. A 10-year climatology of Lambertian surface reflectance from MODIS BRDF/Albedo product (MCD43) is applied for retrievals over the land surface. The global aerosol types are classified based on their sources at different regions, and their corresponding aerosol single scattering properties are defined based on AERONET climatology for each region. The retrieval algorithm is based on the lookup table constructed by the Unified and Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM).",

The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; outgoing longwave radiation (OLR); and an infrared-based precipitation estimate.\n\nThe monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the comprehensive quality control (QC) methodology to form a level-2 daily gridded product. The daily level-3 gridded products are averaged to create the monthly average. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables. \n \nThe CHART system was designed to serve as a seamless follow on to the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AIRS/AMSU) instrument processing system. For comparison, the AIRS/AMSU data collection with the TqJ suffix (TqJoint) from AIRX3STM contains similar meteorological information to this CHART data collection and the CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) data collection SNDRSNIML3CMCCPN contains CRIMSS data processed with an analogous algorithm.",

    "description": "The Daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) 30 arc second, Global Gap-Filled, Snow-Free, (MCD43GF) Version 6  is derived from the 30 arc second Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) MCD43D Version 6 product suite, with additional processing to provide a gap-filled, snow-free product. The highest quality full inversion values were used for the temporal fitting effort and supplemented with lower quality pixels, spatial fitting, and spatial smoothing as needed. The status of each pixel can be found in the quality layer for each band. To generate a snow-free product, pixels with ephemeral snow were removed using the MCD43D41 (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43D41.006) snow flags. The underlying MCD43D utilizes a BRDF model derived from all available high quality cloud clear reflectance data over a 16 day moving window centered on and emphasizing the daily day of interest (the ninth day of each retrieval period as reflected in the Julian date in the filename). This 30arc second BRDF model is then used to produce the Albedo and NBAR products (MCD43D). These BRDF model parameters are computed for MODIS spectral bands 1 through 7 (0.47 um, 0.55 um, 0.67 um, 0.86 um, 1.24 um, 1.64 um, 2.1 um), as well as the shortwave infrared band (0.3-5.0um), visible band (0.3-0.7 um), and near-infrared (0.7-5.0 um) broad bands. \r\n\r\nThe MCD43GF product includes 67 layers containing black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon, isotropic (ISO), volumetric (VOL), geometric (GEO), quality (QA), Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) at local solar noon, and white-sky albedo (WSA). Due to the large file size, each data layer is distributed as a separate HDF file. Users are encouraged to download the quality layers for each of the 10 bands to check quality assessment information before using the BRDF/Albedo data.\r\n\r\nUsers are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications (https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006).\r\n\r\nThe MCD43 product is not recommended for solar zenith angles beyond 70 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe MODIS BRDF/Albedo products have achieved stage 3 (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/newPage.cgi?fileName=maturity) validation.\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\nObservations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo on the ninth day of the 16-day period.\r\n*\tMCD43 products use the snow status weighted to the ninth day instead of the majority snow/no-snow observations from the 16-day period.\r\n*\tBetter quality at high latitudes from use of all available observations for the acquisition period. Collection 5 used only four observations per day.\r\n*\tThe MCD43 products use L2G-lite surface reflectance as input.\r\n*\tIn cases where insufficient high-quality reflectances are obtained, a database with archetypal BRDF parameters is used to supplement the observational data and perform a lower quality magnitude inversion. This database is continually updated with the latest full inversion retrieval for each pixel.\r\n*\tCMG Albedo is estimated using all the clear-sky observations within the 1,000 m grid as opposed to aggregating from the 500 m albedo.\r\n\r\nImportant Quality Information\r\nThe incorrect representation of the aerosol quantities (low average high) in the C6 MYD09 and MOD09 surface reflectance products may have impacted down stream products particularly over arid bright surfaces (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD09&amp;caseNum=PM_MOD09_20010&amp;caseLocation=cases_data&amp;type=C6). This (and a few other issues) have been corrected for C6.1. Therefore users should avoid substantive use of the C6 MCD43 products and wait for the C6.1 products. In any event, users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in MCD43A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QAs provided as part of the MCD43A1, 3, and 4 products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This dataset includes hourly net ecosystem exchange (NEE) simulated by the Tundra Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (TVPRM) at 30 km horizontal resolution for the Alaskan North Slope for 2008-2017. TVPRM calculates tundra NEE from air temperature, soil temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) using functional relationships derived from eddy covariance tower measurements. These relationships were then scaled over the region using gridded meteorology and a vegetation map. The site-level CO2 fluxes fell into two distinct ecosystem groups: inland tundra (ICS, ICT, ICH, IVO) and coastal tundra (ATQ, BES, BEO, CMDL). The expanded modeling framework allowed for the easy substitution of ecological behaviors and environmental drivers, including the choice of representative inland tundra site, coastal tundra site, vegetation map (CAVM, RasterCAVM, or ABoVE-LC), meteorological reanalysis product (NARR or ERA5), and SIF product (GOME2, GOSIF, or CSIF). Using all of these variations generated an ensemble of 288 different TVPRM simulations of regional CO2 flux and one additional simulation option with added aquatic and zero curtain fluxes (AqZC).",

The NUM file for both 3 arc second products (whether sampled or averaged) references the 3 x 3 center pixel.  Note that NUMs less than 6 are water and those greater than 10 are land. The 3 arc second data was derived from the 1 arc second using sampling and averaging methods.

State-level canopy cover data are currently available for Pennsylvania (data for nominal year 2008), Delaware (2014), and Maryland (2013). The data were derived with a rules-based expert system which facilitated integration of leaf-on LiDAR and imagery data into a single classification workflow, exploiting the spectral, height, and spatial information contained in the datasets. Additional states will be added as data processing is completed.",

    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECO3ANCQA Version 1 is a Level 3 (L3) product that provides Quality Assessment (QA) fields for all ancillary data used in L3 and Level 4 (L4) products generated by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). No quality flags are generated for the L3 or L4 products. Instead, the quality flags of the source data products are resampled by nearest neighbor onto the geolocation of the ECOSTRESS scene. A quality flag array for each input dataset, when available, is collected into the combined QA product.\r\n\r\nThe ECO3ANCQA Version 1 data product contains layers of quality flags for ECOSTRESS cloud mask, Landsat 8, land cover type, albedo, MODIS Terra aerosol, MODIS Terra Cloud 1 km, MODIS Terra Cloud 5 km, MODIS Terra atmospheric profile, vegetation indices, MODIS Terra gross primary productivity, and MODIS water mask.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.",

For the conterminous USA, the GCAM global gridded results were downscaled to ~5.6 km (0.05 degree) resolution. For each 5.6 x 5.6 km area, the annual land cover percentage comprised by each of the nineteen different land cover classes/plant functional types (PFTs) of the Community Land Model (CLM) (Table 1) are provided.Results are reported for GCAM runs of three scenarios of future human efforts towards climate mitigation as related to global carbon emissions, radiative forcing, and land cover change. Specific scenario conditions were 1) a reference scenario with no explicit climate mitigation efforts that reaches a radiative forcing level of over 7 W/m2 in 2100, 2) the 2.6 mitigation pathway (MP) scenario which is a very low emission scenario with a mid-century peak in radiative forcing at ~3 W/m2, declining to 2.6 W/m2 in 2100, and 3) the 4.5 MP scenario which stabilizes radiative forcing at 4.5 W/m2 (~ 650 ppm CO2-equivalent) before 2100.These downscaled land cover projections can be used to derive spatially explicit estimates of potential shifts in croplands, grasslands, shrub lands, and forest lands in each future climate scenario.Data are presented as three NetCDF v4 files (.nc4), one for each future climate scenario -- 2.6 MP, 4.5 MP, and GCAM reference).

There is one data file which consists of a spreadsheet table, together with a bibliography of more than 300 original-source references. Although the majority of measurements are from natural or semi-natural ecosystems, some LAI values have been included from crops (limited to a sub-set representing different crops at different stages of development under a range of treatments). Like Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a key parameter for global and regional models of biosphere/atmosphere exchange. Modeling and validation of coarse scale satellite measurements both require field measurements to constrain LAI values for different biomes (typical minimum, maximum values, phenology, etc.). Maximum values for point measurements are unlikely to be approached or exceeded by area-weighted LAI, which is what satellites and true spatial models are estimating.",

There are 10 black-sky albedo and 10 white-sky albedo layers representing MODIS bands 1 through 7 and the visible, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave bands. The black-sky albedo (directional hemispherical reflectance) is defined as albedo in the absence of a diffuse component and is a function of solar zenith angle. White-sky albedo (bihemispherical reflectance) is defined as albedo in the absence of a direct component when the diffuse component is isotropic. \n\nMCD43D51 is the black-sky albedo for the MODIS shortwave broadband. \n\nThe MODIS BRDF/Albedo products have achieved stage 3 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) validation.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).",

The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; outgoing longwave radiation (OLR); and an infrared-based precipitation estimate.\n\n\nThis daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying profile level specific quality control (QC). Specific QC is defined per retrieved geophysical parameter at a given level within a profile. It accepts profile level data from the top of the atmosphere down to the level where the QC algorithm determines that the retrieval is good. Below this level, the data is rejected. Specific QC is designed to maximize the yield of each variable. This is the same methodology used by the AIRS Version 6 processing system.\n\nThe CHART system was designed to serve as a seamless follow on to the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AIRS/AMSU) instrument processing system. For comparison, the AIRS/AMSU data collection AIRX3SPD contains similar meteorological information to this CHART data collection.",

    "title": "Integrated Biosphere Simulator Model (IBIS), Version 2.5",
    "description": "The Integrated Biosphere Simulator (or IBIS) is designed to be a comprehensive model of the terrestrial biosphere. Tthe model represents a wide range of processes, including land surface physics, canopy physiology, plant phenology, vegetation dynamics and competition, and carbon and nutrient cycling. The model generates global simulations of the surface water balance (e.g., runoff), the terrestrial carbon balance (e.g., net primary production, net ecosystem exchange, soil carbon, aboveground and belowground litter, and soil CO2 fluxes), and vegetation structure (e.g., biomass, leaf area index, and vegetation composition). IBIS was developed by Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE) researchers as a first step toward gaining an improved understanding of global biospheric processes and studying their potential response to human activity  [Foley et al. 1996].  IBIS was constructed to explicitly link land surface and hydrological processes, terrestrial biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation dynamics within a single, physically consistent framework. Furthermore, IBIS was one of a new generation of global biosphere models, termed Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (or DGVMs), that consider transient changes in vegetation composition and structure in response to environmental change. Previous global ecosystem models have typically focused on the equilibrium state of vegetation and could not allow vegetation patterns to change over time. Version 2.5 of IBIS includes several major improvements and additions [Kucharik et al. 2000]. SAGE continues to test the performance of the model, assembling a wide range of continental- and global-scale data, including measurements of river discharge, net primary production, vegetation structure, root biomass, soil carbon, litter carbon, and soil CO2 flux. Using these field data and model results for the contemporary biosphere (1965-1994), their evaluation shows that simulated patterns of runoff, NPP, biomass, leaf area index, soil carbon, and total soil CO2 flux agreed reasonably well with measurements that have been compiled from numerous ecosystems. These results also compare favorably to other global model results [Kucharik et al. 2000].",

Additionally, the digital numbers (DN) for the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band are provided. The TIR bands are spatially co-registered to produce a variable spatial resolution between 70 meters (m) and 90 m at the edge of the swath.

On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Missing scan data/striping features: During testing, an instrument artifact was encountered in ECOSTRESS bands 1 and 5, resulting in missing values. A machine learning algorithm has been applied to interpolate missing values.

There are three data files at three spatial resolutions of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree in both latitude and longitude and for the reference year of 1990.Estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are commonly given for nations as a single aggregated number. This data set generates estimates of GDP density distributed subnationally to facilitate the integration of GDP with other data at a sub-national level and to promote interdisciplinary studies that include socioeconomic aspects.  This is one of two coarse resolution Socioeconomic data sets included in the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II data collection, the other being the Gridded Population of the World (GPW), also produced by CIESIN.

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Forecast (omf) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_HIRS2_TIROSN_OMF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "The objective of this limited edition data collection is to examine products generated by the Climate Heritage AIRS Retrieval Technique (CHART) algorithm to analyze Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite).  The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; outgoing longwave radiation (OLR); and an infrared-based precipitation estimate.\n\nThis daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the comprehensive quality control (QC) methodology. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables. \n \nThe CHART system was designed to serve as a seamless follow on to the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AIRS/AMSU) instrument processing system. For comparison, the AIRS/AMSU data collection with the TqJ suffix (TqJoint) from AIRX3SPD contains similar meteorological information to this CHART data collection and the CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) data collection SNDRSNIML3CDCCPN contains CRIMSS data processed with an analogous algorithm.",

    "description": "This dataset provides information about the resilience of tidal wetlands to sea-level rise under three scenarios of global change. With rising seas, regularly inundated tidal wetlands may persist by vertical accretion of sediments (vertical resilience) and/or by migrating inland (lateral resilience), but local and regional conditions constrain these options. This dataset provides a vertical resilience index (VR) for coastal wetlands at 30 m resolution across the continental US predicted for 2100. The VR index was computed for current sea levels, local tidal dynamics, and coastal topography. It was also calculated for future sea levels predicted for 2100 by three IPCC Realized Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios: 2.5, 4.5, and 8.5. Moreover, the VR index incorporates estimated rates of sediment accretion. Relevant to lateral resiliency, the data include current and future tidal areas identified by mapping mean higher high water spring tide locations under the RCP scenarios. A shapefile outlining watershed units with tidal wetlands is included along with land cover classes for these areas for 1996 and 2011.",

This thematic map was resampled to 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree grids. During this re-processing, the original University of Maryland (UMD) land cover type and fraction maps were adjusted to match the water/land fraction of the ISLSCP II land/water mask. These maps were generated for use by modelers of global biogeochemical cycles and others in need of an internally consistent, global depiction of land cover. This 1km map was also one of the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at-launch land cover maps. This product describes the geographic distributions of 13 classes of vegetation cover (plus water and unclassified classes) based on a modified International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) legend.

Land use types, land use transitions, and cropland estimates of area fraction are provided and include detailed separation of primary and secondary natural vegetation into forest and non-forest sub-types, pasture into managed pasture and rangeland, and cropland into multiple crop functional types; all transitions between land use states per grid cell per year, including crop rotations, shifting cultivation, and wood harvest; and agriculture management including irrigation, synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, and biofuel management. The LUH2-ISIMIP2b datasets were derived using Land Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) methodology and are based on land-use scenarios provided by the REMIND-MAgPIE Integrated Assessment Model using an SSP2 storyline along with RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 emissions scenarios. In contrast to the standard SSP scenarios, these land use changes additionally account for climate and atmospheric CO2 fertilization effects on the underlying patterns of potential crop yields, water availability, and terrestrial carbon content. This is achieved by using the LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed land) model forced with atmospheric CO2 concentrations and patterns of climate change generated from 4 different climate models (GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, and MIROC) consistent with the 2 different RCP scenarios, resulting in a set of 8 different LUH2-ISIMIP2b datasets.",

Unlike the VNP21A1 data sets where the daytime and nighttime acquisitions are separate products, the VNP21C3 contains both daytime and nighttime acquisitions as separate Science Dataset (SDS) layers within a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1332/VNP21_ATBD_V1.pdf).",

The data were derived from an inventory-constrained version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) carbon cycle process model that accounts for disturbance processes for each combination of forest type, site productivity, and pre-disturbance biomass. Also provided are the core model data inputs including the year of the most recent disturbance according to the North American Forest Dynamics (NAFD) and the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) data products; the type of disturbance; biomass estimates from the year 2000 according to the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset (NBCD); forest-type group; a site productivity classification; and the number of years since stand-replacing disturbance. The data are useful for a wide range of applications including monitoring and reporting recent dynamics of forest carbon across the conterminous U.S., assessment of recent trends with attribution to disturbance and regrowth drivers, conservation planning, and assessment of climate change mitigation opportunities within the forest sector.",

A high-quality and low-cloud coverage image from Landsat 5 or Landsat 8 over each 5-year period was selected or composited for the January-August timeframe. Investigators used their knowledge to manually identify training polygons in these images for five LUC classes: peat swamp forest, tall shrubs/ secondary forest, low shrubs/ferns/grass, urban/bare land/open flooded areas, and river. Pixel values of Landsat Tier 1 surface reflectance products and selected indices were extracted for each LUC and used to predict LUC classes across the Mawas study area using the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method.

Topsoil loss at the county- and state-levels was derived from analyses of agricultural land at selected sites across the study area. From WorldView imagery, 759 fields were identified that had exposed bare soil (210 km2) and were grouped into 28 sites. Gridded estimates of the SOCI and of the probability of exposed B-horizon soil were determined for each field within the sites. Topography measures, including elevation (m), curvature (m-1), and slope (deg), were extracted over the entire study area from LiDAR-derived digital elevation models at a 4 m resolution acquired from 2003-2018. Within each of the 28 study sites, the SOCI and topographic curvature values were extracted from co-located pixels.

    "description": "The NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Albedo (VNP43MA3) Version 1 product provides albedo values at 1 kilometer (km) resolution for the bihemispherical reflectance white-sky albedo (WSA) and directional hemispherical reflectance black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon. The VNP43MA3 product is produced daily using 16 days of VIIRS data and is weighted temporally to the ninth day, which is reflected in the file name. The VNP43 data products are designed to promote the continuity of NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo data product suite. \r\n\r\nThe VNP43 algorithm uses the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model, with the three kernel weights from (VNP43MA1) (https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43MA1.001) to reconstruct surface anisotropic effects, correcting the directional reflectance to a common view geometry (VNP43MA4) (https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43MA4.001), while also computing integrated black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon and white-sky albedo (WSA) (VNP43MA3). Researchers can use the BRDF model parameters with a simple polynomial, to obtain black-sky albedo at any solar illumination angle. Likewise, both the BSA and WSA Science Dataset (SDS) layers can be used with a simple polynomial, to manually estimate instantaneous actual albedo (blue-sky albedo). Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/194/VNP43_ATBD_V1.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe VNP43MA3 product provides a total of 36 SDS layers including: BSA, WSA, and mandatory quality layers for nine VIIRS moderate bands: M1-M5, M7-M8, and M10-M11, as well as three broadbands: near-infrared (NIR), shortwave, and visible. A low-resolution image is also available showing retrievals of WSA for band I1 in JPEG format.",

The second method (assimilation) was based on the assumption that green vegetation indicates sufficient available water for transpiration (Knorr 1997). The data set was developed to provide alternative means to describe rooting characteristics of the global vegetation cover for land surface and climate models in support of the ISLSCP Initiative II data collection.

LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1 simulates peatland hydrology, permafrost dynamics, peatland vegetation, and methane emissions.The model processes can be simulated on an area-averaged 0.5 or 1.0 degree grid cell basis at global, regional, or site scales and on a daily, monthly, or annual time step as appropriate. Input driver data are monthly mean air temperature, total precipitation, percentage of full sunshine, annual atmospheric CO2 concentration, and soil texture class. The simulation for each grid cell begins from \"bare ground\", requiring a \"spin up\" (under non-transient climate) of ca. 1,000 years to develop equilibrium vegetation, carbon, and soil structure. Model simulations compare favorably, with some exceptions, to field observations collected from peatland sites (e.g., Degero, Sweden; Lakkasuo, Finland; BOREAS Northern Study Area, Canada; and others) and non-peatland sites (e.g., Point Barrow, Alaska, and Spasskaya, Siberia). LPJ-WHyMe is a further development of LPJ-WHy, which dealt with the introduction of permafrost and peatlands into LPJ. Implementing peatlands in LPJ required the addition of two new plant functional types (PFTs) (flood tolerant C3 graminoids and Sphagnum mosses) to the already existing ten PFTs, the introduction of inundation stress for non-peatland PFTs, a slow-down in decomposition under inundation, and the addition of a root exudates pool. LPJ-WHyMe v1.3.1 adds a methane model subroutine. This model product has one compressed data file (*.zip) and seven companion files.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_HIRS2_TIROSN_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "This dataset provides estimates of forest aboveground biomass (AGB; in Mg ha-1) at a resolution of 250 m for the southwestern United States over the time period 2000-2021. The AGB estimates were derived from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) Level 1B2 Terrain radiance data and a multi-angle approach that exploits the relationship between forest AGB and a suite of red band reflectance values modeled at viewing angles with respect to the direction of illumination. The year 2000 National Biomass and Carbon Dataset (NBCD 2000) AGB estimates were used to fit a model coefficient for the MISR-derived AGB estimates for the year 2000, with AGB estimates for all subsequent years dependent on both this coefficient and MISR red band bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs). Quality assurance (QA) files are also provided that allow users to impose criteria of varying stringency. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model-fitting root mean square error (RMSE) value was used as one of the criteria to determine if the AGB estimates were reasonable. This dataset is the first example of forest AGB estimation based on a multi-angle index applied using MISR data.",

The four wildfire sites include the Utikuma fire site of 2011, Kidney Lake fire site of 2011, Fort McMurray west fire site of 2009, and Fort McMurray east fire site of 2009. The peatland classification at 12.5-m resolution (fen vs. bog including treed vs. open vs. shrubby) at each wildfire site was based on a pre-burn 2007 multi-date, multi-sensor fusion (Optical-IR, C-band and L-band SAR) approach. Over 350 field locations were sampled in central Alberta to train and validate the peatland type maps. The additional site, Wabasca, was an unburned site. Burn severity was measured in the field using the Burn Severity Index (BSI) (Dyrness and Norum 1987), a qualitative assessment of burnt moss that uses a 1-5 scale, with 1 being unburnt and 5 being severely burnt. The field data of ground consumption were correlated with Landsat pre- and post-burn imagery, specific to peatlands, to develop multivariate models for calculating burn severity and %-not-sphagnum-moss. These models were used to generate the Burn Severity Maps at 30-m resolution (percent unburned moss, and the burn severity index (BSI)). All sites were visited in 2013 for field measurements and the Utikuma site was also visited in 2012 for field measurements. Additional biophysical data for the various peatlands (aboveground biomass  tree and shrub, plant heights, density, etc. were collected and will be provided in another data set. ",

    "description": "This model product contains the source code for the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED version 1.0) as well as model input and output data files for the conterminous United States. The ED is a mechanistic ecosystem model built around established sub-models of leaf level physiology, organic matter decomposition, hydrology, and functional biodiversity. It was used herein to estimate ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes in the conterminous U.S. at 1.0 degree resolution from 1700 to 1990. Output data of carbon stocks and fluxes are stored in NetCDF format. To produce the U.S. scenario, ED was run from an estimated state of ecosystems in the year 1700 to an estimated state of ecosystems in the year 1990 for each 1 degree by 1 degree grid cell through time using ISLSCP Initiative I climate and soil data and a gridded land-use history reconstruction as inputs (Hurtt et al., 2002). The land-use history was based on several sources including: spatial distribution of potential vegetation in 1700, spatial patterns of cropland from 1700 to 1990, regional estimates of land use and logging from 1700 to 1990, and U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data on the current age distribution of forest stands. The Miami Land Use History Model (Miami-LU), a far simpler empirically-based ecosystem model, was used to track the history of disturbance, land use, fire, and ecosystem recovery. The effects of fire suppression were also included. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climatic conditions were held constant throughout the runs to focus on the consequences of land-use and fire-management changes on carbon stocks and fluxes.",

The emission estimates were derived from a statistical modeling approach based on measurements of carbon consumption at the 211 burned field plots located in seven independent burn scars. Estimates include uncertainty of field observations of aboveground and belowground combustion, as well as prediction uncertainty from a multiplicative regression model. To apply the model across all 2014 NWT fire perimeters, the final model covariates were re-gridded to a common 30-m grid defined by the Arctic Boreal and Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) Project. The regression model was then applied to burned pixels defined by a threshold of Landsat-derived differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) within fire perimeters.

    "description": "The MCD43D01 Version 6.1 Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) Model Parameter data set is a daily 16-day product. This product incorporates the Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) structure in which each file geographically covers the entire earth rather than the 10 degree x 10 degree latitude and longitude tiling system utilized by the standard MODIS land products. Unlike the standard CMG pixel resolution of 5600 meters the MCD43D products are 1000 meters, consequently, because of the large file size each product contains just one layer. The Julian date in the granule ID of each specific file represents the 9th day of the 16 day composite period, and consequently the observations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo for that day. The layer in the MCD43D01 is the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function isotropic parameter for MODIS band 1. This isotropic parameter, in conjunction with the volumetric and geometric parameters, is used to derive the Albedo and BRDF value for MODIS band 1. The MODIS BRDF/ALBEDO products have achieved stage 3 validation.",

Field data were collected during July 8-17, 2016 to parameterize and to validate the derived permafrost maps. The YKD is in the sporadic to isolated permafrost zone where permafrost forms extensive elevated plateaus on abandoned floodplains. The region is extremely flat and vulnerable to eustatic sea-level rise and inland storm surges. These high-resolution permafrost maps support landscape change analyses and assessments of the impacts of climate change on permafrost in this region of high biological productivity, critical wildlife habitats, and subsistence-based human economy.",

The five study topics include Micrometeorology, Climate, Carbon Dioxide and Water Vapor, Plant Physiology, and Soil Moisture. The objectives of the ABRACOS were to monitor Amazonian climate and improve the understanding of the consequences of deforestation and to provide data for the calibration and validation of GCMs and GCM sub-models of Amazonian forest and post-deforestation pasture (Shuttleworth et al, 1991). Three areas were instrumented, each with different soils, dry season intensities and deforestation densities (Gash et al, 1996). In each area, an automatic weather station and soil moisture measurement equipment were installed: in a primary forest site and in nearby cattle pasture, for monitoring climate and soil status throughout the year. Additional intensive periods of study (or Missions), of varying duration, were operated at these sites: for calibration purposes, to understand the physical processes relevant to each site, and for detailed comparisons between sites. These data were collected under the ABRACOS project and made available by the UK Institute of Hydrology and the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (Brazil). ABRACOS is a collaboration between the Agencia Brasileira de Cooperacao and the UK Overseas Development Administration. The processed, quality controlled and integrated data in the documented Pre-LBA data sets were originally published as a set of three CD_ROMs (Marengo and Victoria, 1998) but are now archived individually.",

    "description": "ACTIVATE-MODIS-MERRA2 is the merged CERES MODIS and MERRA-2 dataset (pixel-level geostationary cloud products) produced by SatCORPS group at NASA Langley Research Center in support of ACTIVATE. \r\nACTIVATE was a 5-year NASA Earth-Venture Sub-Orbital (EVS-3) field campaign. Marine boundary layer clouds play a critical role in Earth’s energy balance and water cycle. These clouds cover more than 45% of the ocean surface and exert a net cooling effect. The Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western Atlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) project was a five-year project that provides important globally-relevant data about changes in marine boundary layer cloud systems, atmospheric aerosols and multiple feedbacks that warm or cool the climate. ACTIVATE studied the atmosphere over the western North Atlantic and sampled its broad range of aerosol, cloud and meteorological conditions using two aircraft, the UC-12 King Air and HU-25 Falcon. The UC-12 King Air was primarily used for remote sensing measurements while the HU-25 Falcon will contain a comprehensive instrument payload for detailed in-situ measurements of aerosol, cloud properties, and atmospheric state. A few trace gas measurements were also onboard the HU-25 Falcon for the measurements of pollution traces, which will contribute to airmass classification analysis. A total of 150 coordinated flights over the western North Atlantic occurred through 6 deployments from 2020-2022. The ACTIVATE science observing strategy intensively targets the shallow cumulus cloud regime and aims to collect sufficient statistics over a broad range of aerosol and weather conditions which enables robust characterization of aerosol-cloud-meteorology interactions. This strategy was implemented by two nominal flight patterns: Statistical Survey and Process Study. The statistical survey pattern involves close coordination between the remote sensing and in-situ aircraft to conduct near coincident sampling at and below cloud base as well as above and within cloud top. The process study pattern involves extensive vertical profiling to characterize the target cloud and surrounding aerosol and meteorological conditions.",

Biomass estimates are limited to areas of the Great Basin defined as a pinyon-juniper ecosystem type by the 2016 Landfire Existing Vegetation Type map. The estimates of biomass were based on a linear relationship with pinyon-juniper canopy cover and crown-based allometrics developed from field data in Nevada and Idaho. Canopy cover was estimated from remote sensing by using annual composites of Landsat imagery, which were temporally segmented with the LandTrendr algorithm, along with biologically-relevant climate variables, and topographic indices in a Random Forest regression model. Models of canopy cover were trained from semi-automatic extraction of tree crowns from 2011 - 2013 high resolution imagery (1 m) from the National Agriculture Imagery Program, which were validated with photo interpretation.  Maps of the standard deviation of biomass estimates from decision trees in the Random Forest model are provided as an indicator of uncertainty.

Daily estimates of GPP were derived from a light-curve model that was fitted and validated over a network of ABoVE domain Ameriflux flux towers then upscaled using MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) data to span the extended ABoVE domain. In general, the methods involved three steps; the first step involved collecting and processing mainly carbon-flux site-level data, the second step involved the analysis and correction of site-level MAIAC data, and the final step developed a framework to produce large-scale estimates of GPP. The light-curve parameter model was generated by upscaling from flux tower sub-daily temporal resolution by deconvolving the GPP variable into 3 components: the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (aPAR), the maximum GPP or maximum photosynthetic capacity (GPPmax), and the photosynthetic limitation or amount of light needed to reach maximum capacity (PPFDmax). GPPmax and PPFDmax were related to satellite reflectance measurements sampled at the daily scale. GPP over the extended ABoVE domain was estimated at a daily resolution from the light-curve parameter model using MODIS MAIAC daily reflectance as input. This framework allows large-scale estimates of phenology and evaluation of ecosystem sensitivity to climate change.",

The continuous fields describe sub-pixel proportions of cover for tree, herbaceous, bare ground and water cover types. For tree cover, additional fields describing leaf longevity (evergreen and deciduous) and leaf morphology (broadleaf and needleleaf) were also generated. The modeling of carbon dynamics and climate require knowing tree characteristics such as these. These products were resampled and aggregated to 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree grids for the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) data initiative II. The data set describes the geographic distributions of three fundamental vegetation characteristics: tree, herbaceous and bare ground cover, plus a water layer. For tree cover, leaf longevity and morphology layers were produced.This data set is one of the products of the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP II) data collection which contains 50 global time series data sets for the ten-year period 1986 to 1995. Selected data sets span even longer periods. ISLSCP II is a consistent collection of data sets that were compiled from existing data sources and algorithms, and were designed to satisfy the needs of modelers and investigators of the global carbon, water and energy cycle. The data were acquired from a number of U.S. and international agencies, universities, and institutions. The global data sets were mapped at consistent spatial (1, 0.5 and 0.25 degrees) and temporal (monthly, with meteorological data at finer (e.g., 3-hour)) resolutions and reformatted into a common ASCII format. The data and documentation have undergone two peer reviews.ISLSCP is one of several projects of Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) [http://www.gewex.org/] and has the lead role in addressing land-atmosphere interactions -- process modeling, data retrieval algorithms, field experiment design and execution, and the development of global data sets.",

LINKAGES predicts long-term structure and dynamics of forest ecosystems as constrained by nitrogen availability, climate, and soil moisture. Model simulations compare favorably to field data from different geographic areas worldwide. LINKAGES, written in FORTRAN and provided in ASCII format, simulates birth, growth, and death of all trees greater than 1.43-cm dbh. Litter fall and decomposition are also simulated. Sunlight is the driving variable. Growing season degree days, soil water availability, and AET are calculated from precipitation, temperature, soil field moisture capacity, and wilting point. Decomposition and soil N availability are calculated from organic matter quantity and carbon chemistry, evapotranspiration, and degree of canopy closure. Light availability to each tree is a function of leaf biomass of taller trees. Degree days and availabilities of light and water constrain species reproduction. These variables plus soil N constrain tree growth and carbon accumulation in biomass. Tree death probability increases with age and slow growth. Leaf, root, and woody litter are returned to the soil at the end of each year to decay the following year. Climatic and forest data for eastern North America and New South Wales are provided as example model inputs. Modelers may use their own site data within any version of LINKAGES.

Data entries originated from peer-reviewed literature and personal communications with researchers involved in Fluxnet. Flux estimates were included in the database when they were based on direct measurements (e.g., tower-based eddy covariance system measurements), derived from single or multiple direct measurements, or modeled. Stand description was based on observed values, and climatic description was based on the CRU data set and ORCHIDEE model output. Uncertainty for each carbon balance component in the database was estimated in a uniformed way by expert judgment. Robustness of CO2 balances was tested, and closure terms were introduced as a numerical way to approach data quality and flux uncertainty at the biome level.",

    "description": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is a critical parameter for monitoring the status of permafrost that is typically measured at specific locations using probing, in situ temperature sensors, or other ground-based observations. The thickness of the active layer is the average annual thaw depth, in permafrost areas, due to solar heating of the surface. This data set includes the mean Remotely Sensed Active Layer Thickness (ReSALT) over years 2006 to 2011 for the region near Barrow, Alaska. The data were produced by an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique that measures seasonal surface subsidence and infers ALT. ReSALT estimates were validated by comparison with ground-based ALT obtained using probing and Ground Penetrating Radar at multiple sites. These results indicate remote sensing techniques based on InSAR could be an effective way to measure and monitor ALT over large areas on the Arctic coastal plain.These data provide gridded (30-m) estimates of active layer thickness (cm; ALT) and seasonal subsidence (cm), as well as calculated uncertainty in each of these parameters.

PAR, SANIRv and C4 fraction are used to drive a parsimonious model with only two parameters to estimate GPP, along with a quantitative uncertainty, on a per-pixel and daily basis.

    "description": "This dataset provides the results of field measurements and estimates of carbon stocks and combustion rates that characterize burned and unburned southern boreal forest stands near the La Ronge and Weyakwin communities in central Saskatchewan (SK), Canada. Measurements were completed in 2016 at 47 stands that burned in the 2015 Saskatchewan wildfires (Egg, Philion, and Brady) and at 32 unburned stands in comparable adjacent areas. Stands were characterized through field observations and sampling of the vegetative community (i.e., tree species, abundance, and biophysical measurements, stand age, coarse woody debris, history of fires or logging), soils (i.e., soil moisture class, unburned and burned soil organic layer depth, samples for bulk density and carbon analyses), and basic landscape geophysical traits. From these results, the pre-fire carbon stocks and carbon combustion values from both the above- and below-ground pools were estimated using a combination of linear and mixed-effects modeling and were calibrated against carbons stocks from the unburned stands. Estimates of uncertainty were generated for above- and below-ground carbon stocks and combustion values using a Monte Carlo framework paired with classic uncertainty propagation techniques.",

Estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marsh areas were based on a 2010 NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) map. Aboveground biomass maps were generated from a random forest model driven by Landsat vegetation indices and a national scale dataset of field-measured aboveground biomass. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices, with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important, successfully predicted biomass for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle, and growth form. Biomass can be converted to carbon stocks using a mean plant carbon content of 44.1%.",

    "title": "Biome-BGC: Terrestrial Ecosystem Process Model, Version 4.1.1",
    "description": "Biome-BGC is a computer program that estimates fluxes and storage of energy, water, carbon, and nitrogen for the vegetation and soil components of terrestrial ecosystems. The primary model purpose is to study global and regional interactions between climate, disturbance, and biogeochemical cycles. Biome-BGC represents physical and biological processes that control fluxes of energy and mass. These processes include new leaf growth and old leaf litterfall, sunlight interception by leaves and penetration to the ground, precipitation routing to leaves and soil, snow accumulation and melting, drainage and runoff of soil water, evaporation of water from soil and wet leaves, transpiration of soil water through leaf stomata, photosynthetic fixation of carbon from CO2 in the air, uptake of nitrogen from the soil, distribution of carbon and nitrogen to growing plant parts, decomposition of fresh plant litter and old soil organic matter, plant mortality, and fire. The model uses a daily time-step, meaning that each flux is estimated for a one-day period. Between days, the program updates its memory of the mass stored in different components of the vegetation, litter, and soil. Weather is the most important control on vegetation processes. Flux estimates in Biome-BGC depend strongly on daily weather conditions. Model behavior over time depends on climate--the history of these weather conditions. A companion file with more information about Biome-BGC and its components is available. Biome-BGC, Version 4.1.1, was developed and is maintained by the  Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group, School of Forestry, the University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, U.S.A.

The study sites in Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa are located along the Kalahari Transect precipitation gradient. Some of the sites were relatively undisturbed while others had different intensities of cultivation, domestic grazing, and fires. The data were collected to detect patterns of N cycling along precipitation and grazing gradients, including N2 fixation by legumes. Data from different multiple projects are included. The plants and soils were sampled mainly in the wet season of years 1995, 1999, and 2000, with most of the data collected during the SAFARI 2000 Kalahari Wet Season Field Campaign in February and March of 2000. Some grass samples were collected in the dry season of year 2000 (from Mongu-dambo and Sua Pan grassland sites). Soil and plant samples were analyzed in a laboratory for %C, %N, d13C, and d15N with an Optima isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to an elemental analyzer. The stable isotope ratios are expressed using standard delta notation in units per mil. The isotope ratios are expressed relative to the international standard PDB (Pee Dee Belemnite) for carbon and atmospheric N2 for nitrogen samples. The carbon and nitrogen contents are expressed in percentage weight of the dry sample.The data files contain numerical and character fields of varying length separated by commas (.csv format).",

    "title": "Ecosystem Demography Model: Scaling Vegetation Dynamics Across South America",
    "description": "This model product contains the source code for the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED version 1.0) as well as model input and output data for a portion of South America including the Brazilian Amazon. The model output data are estimates of potential average live biomass (kg C/m2), potential average soil carbon (kg C/m2), and potential above-ground net primary production (NPP) (kg C/m2/yr) at 1.0 degree resolution. To produce these estimates, ED was forced with ISLSCP I data for 1987 and 1988, averaged into a single year (Moorcroft et al., 2001). Data for the three estimates are provided in both ASCII text and in NetCDF formatted files. ED is an individual-based terrestrial ecosystem model that predicts both ecosystem structure (e.g. above and below-ground biomass, vegetation height and basal area, and soil carbon stocks) and corresponding ecosystem fluxes (e.g. NPP, NEP and evapotranspiration) from climate, soil, and land-use inputs. The model consists of integrated sub-models governing processes such as leaf-level physiology, plant allocation, allometry, phenology, dispersal, the effects of fire disturbances, and below-ground sub-models for soil carbon dynamics and hydrology. Using a new method for scaling-up it is possible to predict ED's large-scale behavior without simulating the fate of every plant individually. ED is used to examine how climate and edaphic factors, natural disturbances, and human land-use practices affect ecosystem structure and fluxes. This data set contains six zip files which each uncompress into six unique subdirectories. Each subdirectory is described in detail in the Model Product Description section of this document. Installation and execution instructions are provided in the Model Documentation and User's Guide section of this document. ",

The original data set was the first representation of combined snow and sea ice measurements derived from satellite observations for the period of record. Designed to facilitate study of Northern Hemisphere seasonal fluctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent, the original NSIDC data set also includes monthly climatologies describing average extent, probability of occurrence, and variance.This data set shows the extent of snow on the land at a variety of scales (1.0 degree, 0.5 degree, 0.25 degree). The values represent the percentage of days in each month where snow was present -- 100 means 100% of the month, 80 means 80% of the month, etc. There are 4 .zip files provided. Missing data is represented by -99 for water and -88 for land. The data were originally in a yearly tabular format.

    "description": "This data set provides local LAI maps for the selected measured sites in Canada. These derived maps may also be useful for validating other LAI maps over these same sites given that the areas are protected from disturbance. The maps should be used for the given period of validity. The LAI data are suitable for use in modeling the carbon, water, energy, energy and trace gas exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere at regional scales. The data set may also be useful for monitoring changes in the land surface.The Leaf Area Index (LAI) maps are at 30-m resolution for the selected sites. LAI is defined here as half the total (all-sided) live foliage area per unit horizontal projected ground surface area. Overstory LAI corresponds to all tree foliage except for treeless areas where it corresponds to total foliage. The algorithms were developed from ground measurements and Landsat TM and ETM+ images (Fernandes et. al., 2003). A mask was developed using the Landsat ETM+/TM5 image and available land cover map to identify only those areas with land cover belonging to the sample land cover classes and with Landsat ETM+/TM5 spectral reflectance values that fell within the convex hull of the spectral reflectance values over the plots. LAI was mapped within the masked region using the Landsat ETM+/TM5 image and the developed transfer function. The final LAI map was scaled by a factor of 20 (offset 0). The LAI maps are in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF).",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_MSU_TIROSN_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

This product incorporates the Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) structure in which each file geographically covers the entire earth rather than the 10 degree x 10 degree latitude and longitude tiling system utilized by the standard MODIS land products. Unlike the standard CMG pixel resolution of 5600 meters the MCD43D products are 1000 meters, consequently, because of the large file size each product contains just one layer. The Julian date in the granule ID of each specific file represents the 9th day of the 16 day composite period, and consequently the observations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo for that day. The layer in the MCD43D02 is the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function volumetric parameter for MODIS band 1. This volumetric parameter, in conjunction with the isotropic and geometric parameters, is used to derive the Albedo and BRDF value for MODIS band 1. The MODIS BRDF/ALBEDO products have achieved stage 3 validation.",

This database was the source of data for the current product. The spatial coverage of the Northern and Mid Latitude Soil Database is the polar and mid-latitude regions of the northern hemisphere: Alaska, Canada, Conterminous United States, Eurasia (except Italy), Greenland, Iceland, Kazakstan, Mexico, Mongolia, Italy, and Svalbard. The Northern and Mid-Latitude Soil Database represents the proportion (percentage) of polygon encompassed by the dominant soil or nonsoil. Soils include turbels, orthels, histels, histosols, mollisols, vertisols, aridisols, andisols, entisols, spodosols, inceptisols (and hapludolls), alfisols (cryalf and udalf), natric great groups, aqu-suborders, glaciers, and rocklands. Also included are data on the circumpolar distribution of gelisols (turbels, orthels, and histels), and the ice content (low, medium, or high) of circumpolar soil materials (from the International Permafrost Association, 1997). The resulting maps show the dominant soil of the spatial polygon unless the polygon is over 90 percent rock or ice. Data are in the U.S. soil classification system and includes the distribution of soil types (%) within a map unit (polygon). Data are available in ESRI shapefile format and include the same attribute values with the exception of Italy, which does not contain distribution values.",

Ten secondary forest study sites were selected within the three fazendas where post-pasture forest recovery ranged from 0 to 14 years since abandonment.From 2000-2001 estimates of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy cover were derived from hemispherical canopy digital photographs, and estimates of aboveground biomass and basal area were derived utilizing allometric equations from diameter at breast height (DBH) measurements. Estimates were classified by growth-form and diameter class. See Feldpausch et al. (2005) for more information.

Field observations were used to estimate area burned in each of five severity classes (unburned, singed, light, moderate, severely burned) in six stratified randomly selected plots of 10 x 10-m in size across a 1-ha site.

A soil database for model fitting and validation was compiled from 49 different studies with spatially explicit empirical depth profile data and associated metadata, totaling 1,959 soil cores from 18 of the 22 coastal states. Reported estimates of carbon stocks were derived with modeling approaches that included (1) applying a single average carbon stock value from the compiled soil core data, (2) applying models fit using the empirical data and applied spatially using soil, vegetation and salinity maps, (3) relying on independently generated soil carbon maps from The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), and the NWI that intersected with mapped tidal wetlands, and (4) using a version of SSURGO bias-corrected for bulk density.

    "description": "The NCAR LSM 1.0 is a land surface model developed to examine biogeophysical and biogeochemical land-atmosphere interactions, especially the effects of land surfaces on climate and atmospheric chemistry. It can be run coupled to an atmospheric model or uncoupled, in a stand-alone mode, if an atmospheric forcing is provided. The model runs on a spatial grid that can range from one point to global. The model was designed for coupling to atmospheric numerical models. Consequently, there is a compromise between computational efficiency and the complexity with which the necessary atmospheric, ecological, and hydrologic processes are parameterized. The model is not meant to be a detailed micrometeorological model, but rather a simplified treatment of surface fluxes that reproduces at minimal computational cost the essential characteristics of land-atmosphere interactions important for climate simulations. The model is a complete executable code with its own time-stepping driver, initialization (subroutine lsmini), and main calling routine (subroutine lsmdrv). When coupled to an atmospheric model, the atmospheric model is the time-stepping driver. There is one call to subroutine lsmini during initialization to initialize all land points in the domain; there is one call per time step to subroutine lsmdrv to calculate surface fluxes and update the ecological, hydrological, and thermal state for all land points in the domain. The model writes its own restart and history files. These can be turned off if appropriate.

    "description": "This archived model product contains the directions, executables, and procedures for running Biome-BGC, Version 4.1.1, to recreate the results of the following article: Thornton, P. E., B. E. Law, H. L. Gholz, K. L. Clark, E. Falge, D. S. Ellsworth, A. H. Goldstein, R. K. Monson,  D. Hollinger, M. Falk, J. Chen, and J. P. Sparks. 2002. Modeling and measuring the effects of disturbance history and climate on carbon and water budgets in evergreen needleleaf forests. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 113:185-222. Abstract: The effects of disturbance history, climate, and changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and nitrogen deposition (Ndep) on carbon and water fluxes in seven North American evergreen forests are assessed using a coupled water, carbon, nitrogen model, canopy-scale flux observations, and descriptions of the vegetation type, management practices, and disturbance histories at each site. The effects of interannual climate variability, disturbance history, and vegetation ecophysiology on carbon and water fluxes and storage are integrated by the ecosystem process model Biome-BGC, with results compared to site biometric analyses and eddy covariance observations aggregated by month and year.  The model produced good estimates of between-site variation in leaf area index, with mixed performance for between- and within-site variation in evapotranspiration. There is a model bias toward smaller annual carbon sinks at five sites, with a seasonal model bias toward smaller warm-season sink strength at all sites.",

    "description": "This dataset provides an annual time series of Landsat green surface reflectance and the derived annual trend during the growing season (June and July) for 472,890 lakes across the ABoVE Extended Study Domain from 1984 to 2019. The reflectance data are from Landsat-5, Landsat-7, and Landsat-8 sensors for the green band (center wavelength 560 nm). Over 270,000 Landsat scenes were evaluated and quality assured to be cloud-free and over water. Lakes were selected from HydroLAKES, a global database of lakes of at least 10 ha. Lake surface reflectance was extracted from a 3-by-3-pixel area centered on each lake centroid from the selected Landsat scenes determined from lake polygons. This dataset demonstrates changes in lake color over time in the arctic and boreal regions of North America. Color is relevant for understanding physical, ecological, and biogeochemical processes in some of the world&amp;rsquo;s highest concentrations of lakes where climate change may have significant impacts.",

This dataset provides water-level change observations throughout wetlands of the Atchafalaya and Terrebonne Basins, in Southern Louisiana, USA, within the Mississippi River Delta (MRD), and it may be used to generate time series analysis. The data were collected by Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), a polarimetric L-band synthetic aperture radar flown on the NASA Gulfstream-III (C20) aircraft as part of the Delta-X campaign. Water surface elevations were measured on multiple flights at 30-minute intervals. Data quality was assessed by comparing water elevation estimates with data from in situ water level gauges throughout the study area. The data include interferogram phase, interferogram amplitude, unwrapped interferogram phase, and coherence products in ENVI format.",

    "description": "This data set for the ISLSCP Initiative II data collection provides meteorology data with fixed, monthly, monthly-6-hourly, 6-hourly, and 3-hourly temporal resolutions. The data were derived from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) near-surface meteorology data set, 40-year re-analysis, or ERA-40 (Simmons and Gibson, 2000), which covers the years 1957 to 2001. The data were processed onto the ISLSCP II Earth grid with a spatial resolution of 1-degree in both latitude and longitude, and span the common ISLSCP II period from 1986 to 1995.The ECMWF forecast system is called the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) and was developed in co-operation with Meteo-France. For ERA40 it is used with 60 levels from the top of the model at 10 Pa to the lowest level at about 10 m above the surface. There are 46 compressed (.tar.gz) data files with this data set. Each uncompressed file contains space-delimited text (.asc) data files.",

    "description": "This dataset provides ecosystem-types for the Slave River Delta (SRD) and Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), Canada, for the time periods circa 2007 and circa 2017. The image resolution is 12.5 m with 0.2-hectare minimum mapping unit. Included are an 18-class modified Enhanced Wetland Classification (EWC) scheme for wetland, peatland, and upland areas. Classes were derived from a Random Forest classification trained on multi-seasonal moderate-resolution images and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery sourced from aerial and satellite sensors, field data, and calculated indices. Indices included Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) and Topographic Position Index (TPI), both derived from a digital elevation model, to differentiate between land cover types. The c. 2007 remote sensing data were comprised of early and late growing season Landsat-5, ERS2, L-Band PALSAR from 2006 to 2010 and growing season Landsat thermal composites. The c. 2017 remote sensing data were comprised of early and late growing season Landsat-8 and L-Band PALSAR-2 from 2017 to 2019, Sentinel-1 June VV and VH mean and standard deviations, and growing season Landsat thermal composites. Elevation indices from multi-resolution TPI and HAND were created from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Advanced Land Observing Satellite 30 m Global Spatial Data Model. Also included are the images used for classification and the classification error matrices for each map and time period. Data are provided in GeoTIFF and GeoPackage file formats.",

It can be viewed as a data assimilation applied in a water balance model context (conceptually similar to the commonly used 4DDA techniques used in meteorological modeling). Such a data assimilation scheme preserves the spatial specificity of the water balance calculations while constrained by the more accurate discharge measurement. There are 11 data files in this data set and 1 changemap file which shows the differences between the ISLSCP II land/water mask and the original data set.",

    "description": "This data set provides four related spatial data products for four study areas across the Brazilian Amazon: Manaus, Amazonas; Tapajos National Forest, Para Western (Santarem); Rio Branco, Acre; and Rondonia, Rondonia. Products include vector data showing (1) roads, (2) rivers, and (3) hypsography and (4) digital elevation model (DEM) images that were encoded from the hypsography vectors. There are 15 data files with this data set which includes 12 compressed *.zip files containing ArcInfo shape files and 3 GeoTIFFS.This data set contains vector data showing roads, rivers, and hypsography for each study area in ESRI ArcGIS shapefile format. The vectors were hand-digitized by the Images Company in Brazil from paper maps produced by the Brazilian government. Depending on the scale of the original maps, the digitization errors vary. For some maps, some vectors are missing. Data were manually checked for duplicate or extra vectors. These data sets were derived from several map sheets produced from aerial coverages dating from 1974 to 1978.The DEM images were encoded from the hypsography vectors and are provided in GeoTIFF format. The attribute value associated with each line and point in the vector segment is encoded into the image channel; the image channel is then filled in by interpolating image data between encoded vector data.  For each DEM:  1 image channel with pixel resolution = 25m x 25m.  DEM images are provided for Manaus, Tapajos National Forest, and Rondonia.  The files for Rio Branco were unusable due to a documentation error.DATA QUALITY STATEMENT: The Data Center has determined that there are questions about the quality of the data reported in this data set. The data set has missing or incomplete data, metadata, or other documentation that diminishes the usability of the products. KNOWN PROBLEMS:The data providers note that due to limited resources, these data have been neither validated nor quality-assured for general use. For that reason, extreme caution is advised when considering the use of these data. - Any use of the derived data is not recommended because the results have not been validated.- However, the DEM, vectors, and orthorectified SAR data (related data set) can be used if the user understands how these were produced and accepts the limitations.",

Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. This Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) product covers the entire globe for use in climate simulation models. Due to the large file size, each MCD43D product contains just one data layer. Each of the three model parameters (isotropic, volumetric, and geometric) for each of the MODIS bands 1 through 7 and the visible, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave bands included in MCD43C1 (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43C1.006) are stored in a separate file as MCD43D01 through MCD43D30. \r\n\r\nMCD43D03 is the BRDF geometric parameter for MODIS band 1. The geometric parameter, in conjunction with the isotropic and volumetric parameters, is used to derive the BRDF/Albedo values for MODIS band 1. \r\n\r\nUsers are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications (https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006).\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\n*\tObservations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo on the ninth day of the 16-day period.\r\n*\tMCD43 products use the snow status weighted to the ninth day instead of the majority snow/no-snow observations from the 16-day period.\r\n*\tBetter quality at high latitudes from use of all available observations for the acquisition period.

This database is continually updated with the latest full inversion retrieval for each pixel.\r\n*\tCMG Albedo is estimated using all the clear-sky observations within the 1,000 m grid for MCD43D as opposed to aggregating from the 500 m albedo.\r\n\r\nImportant Quality Information\r\nThe incorrect representation of the aerosol quantities (low average high) in the C6 MYD09 and MOD09 surface reflectance products may have impacted down stream products particularly over arid bright surfaces (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD09&amp;caseNum=PM_MOD09_20010&amp;caseLocation=cases_data&amp;type=C6). This (and a few other issues) have been corrected for C6.1. Therefore users should avoid substantive use of the C6 MCD43 products and wait for the C6.1 products.

The volumetric parameter, in conjunction with the isotropic and geometric parameters, is used to derive the BRDF/Albedo values ffor the MODIS visible broadband. \r\n\r\nUsers are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications (https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006).\r\n\r\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\r\n\r\n*\tObservations are weighted to estimate the BRDF/Albedo on the ninth day of the 16-day period.\r\n*\tMCD43 products use the snow status weighted to the ninth day instead of the majority snow/no-snow observations from the 16-day period.\r\n*\tBetter quality at high latitudes from use of all available observations for the acquisition period. Collection 5 used only four observations per day.\r\n*\tThe MCD43 products use L2G-lite surface reflectance as input.\r\n*\tWhen there are insufficient high quality reflectances, a database with archetypal BRDF parameters is used to supplement the observational data and perform a lower quality magnitude inversion. This database is continually updated with the latest full inversion retrieval for each pixel.\r\n*\tCMG Albedo is estimated using all the clear-sky observations within the 1,000 m grid for MCD43D as opposed to aggregating from the 500 m albedo.\r\n\r\nImportant Quality Information\r\nThe incorrect representation of the aerosol quantities (low average high) in the C6 MYD09 and MOD09 surface reflectance products may have impacted down stream products particularly over arid bright surfaces (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD09&amp;caseNum=PM_MOD09_20010&amp;caseLocation=cases_data&amp;type=C6). This (and a few other issues) have been corrected for C6.1. Therefore users should avoid substantive use of the C6 MCD43 products and wait for the C6.1 products. In any event, users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in MCD43A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QAs provided as part of the MCD43A1, 3, and 4 products.\r\n\r\n",

Each AGP file pertains to a single Terra orbital path. MISR production software relies on information in the AGP, such as digital terrain elevation, as input to the algorithms which generate MISR products. The AGP contains eleven fields of geographical data. This product consists primarily of geolocation data on a Space Oblique Mercator (SOM) Grid. It has 233 parts, corresponding to the 233 repeat orbits of the EOS-AM1 Spacecraft. The MISR instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four cameras pointing forward, and four cameras pointing aftward. It takes seven minutes for all nine cameras to view the same surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees. The spectral band shapes are nominally Gaussian, centered at 443, 555, 670, and 865 nm.",

    "description": "MOOSE_AircraftRemoteSensing_NASA-G3_GCAS_Data contains remotely sensed data collected by the GEOstationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) Airborne Simulator (GCAS) onboard NASA's Gulfstream-III (G-3) aircraft during the Michigan-Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE).\r\n\r\nThe Michigan-Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE) is an international collaboration between US and Canadian agencies: the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP), the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE). These agencies conducted three field experiments to ensure a viable ozone attainment strategy which, due to their common goal, were given the common name MOOSE. The three field experiments that MOOSE encapsulates are: the Great Lakes Meteorology and Ozone Recirculation (GLAMOR) experiment, the Chemical Source Signatures (CHESS) experiment, and the Methane Releases from Landfills and Gas Lines (MERLIN) experiment. Field studies were conducted for MOOSE in 2021 and 2022. MOOSE consists of two phases, with the first occurring over six weeks from May to June 2021, and the second phase occurring during the summer of 2022. Both airborne and ground instruments are used in completing the campaign’s main goal of aiding in the creation of an ozone attainment strategy for Southeast Michigan (SEMI). SEMI is currently designated as in-marginal nonattainment of the U.S. federal ozone standard. The campaign also has the goal of better understanding what contributes to elevated ozone levels in the Border region, the immediate area on both sides of the US-Canada border. Along with understanding the contributing factors of elevated ozone levels, the campaign aims to understand how the elevated ozone levels cause exceedances to the Canadian ambient air quality standard for ozone.\r\n\r\nIn addition to MOOSE’s overarching goals, GLAMOR, CHESS, and MERLIN have their own objectives to fulfill. GLAMOR seeks to understand and simulate complex 3D flows that are associated with lake breeze circulations, the urban heat island (UHI) and its interaction with the lake breeze, and the impact of lake breezes and the UHI on ozone and ozone precursor transport. GLAMOR also aims to understand and track the influence of urban emissions and land-lake breezes on urban oxidative capacity through nitrous acid (HONO) and related reactive nitrogen species. Determining the conceptual picture (mesoscale meteorological patterns and photochemical production locations) for ozone exceedances in the Border region is what this campaign aims to achieve as well. Finally, GLAMOR aims to select representative ozone episodes for each identified mesoscale pattern, as well as conduct modeling and data analyses in support of an ozone attainment demonstration. The second sub-experiment, CHESS, has a goal to characterize the ozone precursor signatures at the key monitoring stations in the Border region where design values are highest during ozone exceedances in the typical year. CHESS will characterize emission plumes from point sources, area sources, and major industrial sectors in the Border region as well as their impacts on ozone design values on the two sides of the U.S. and Canada border. CHESS also aims to perform air quality model simulations of potential emission control strategies. The third sub-experiment, MERLIN, seeks to determine the natural gas leakage rate of pipelines or other infrastructure in SEMI. Quantifying methane, formaldehyde, and other emissions from landfills in the Border region as well as determining the contributions of large methane sources to ozone exceedances in the Border region are the two other objectives MERLIN is set to accomplish. In doing this, potential control strategies of gas emission into the atmosphere can be drafted and implemented.\r\n\r\nThe three sub-experiments are equipped with their own payloads and stations where research is conducted. GLAMOR uses ground stations and Aerodyne Networks to gather data from MECP’s Windsor West air monitoring station in Ontario, EGLE’s Detroit East 7 Mile PAMS Station, EGLE’s Port Huron monitoring station, as well as collecting field measurements of concentration and isotopic composition of NOx, HONO, NO2, HNO3, and NO3. CHESS utilizes mobile labs, ground stations, and the NASA Gulfstream III (G-III) aircraft while working with the Aerodyne Mobile lab, University of Michigan Pollution Assessment Lab (MPAL), and MECP Mobile Lab. CHESS utilizes these tools and payloads to measure CH4, HCHO, CO2, CO, H2O, O3, SO2, and NOx. MERLIN utilizes mobile labs, drones, and ground stations to work with the University of Michigan Mobile Lab, the Colorado State University Mobile Lab, and the EPA mobile lab. Drone-mounted meteorological chemical sensors for CH4, CH2O, and O3 precursors as well as the EPA GMAP mobile platform are used to measure hydrogen sulfide, methane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-o-p xylene, and ozone, as well as meteorological parameters.",

    "description": "The data set provides a 30-m comprehensive fuelbed characteristics map for both the wildland and cropland areas of the conterminous United States (CONUS) for 2010. This integrated product is the result of combining the spatially discrete Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) data of the US Forest Service (USFS) with the crop-and grassland-specific information of the US Department of Agricultures (USDA's) Cropland Data Layer (CDL).  By combining the spatially discrete details of the FCCS data set with the crop-and grassland-specific information of the CDL, a more robust map of fuelbed characteristics is available. The merged product has an advantage over the original FCCS map for estimating emissions from burned areas due to the integration of the fuelbed characteristics for agricultural areas from the CDL.There are three GeoTIFF format files and three comma-separated companion files distributed with this data set. The three tif files provided are very large and exceed the size limits of a standard GeoTIFF file format (4 GB). File sizes range from 20 to 30 GB. Compressed file sizes range from 2 to 3 GB. They are in a format that is called a BigTIFF file. ArcGIS 10.0 and ERDAS Imagine are able to read these files.",

    "description": "This data set for the ISLSCP Initiative II data collection provides near surface meteorological variables, fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum at the surface, and land surface state variables, all with a spatial resolution of 1 degree in both latitude and longitude. There are four temporal categories of data: time invariant and monthly mean annual cycle fields (together referred to as \"fixed\" fields), monthly mean fields, monthly 3-hourly diurnal, and 3-hourly fields. Two types of variables exist in this data; instantaneous fields (primarily state variables), and average fields (primarily flux fields expressed as a rate). The Center for Ocean-Land Atmosphere Studies (COLA) near-surface data set for ISLSCP II was derived from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Model Inter-comparison Project (AMIP-II) reanalysis (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/reanalysis2/), covering the years from 1979-2003. The data set for ISLSCP II covers the period from 1986 to 1995. The purpose of the reanalysis was to provide an improved version of the original NCEP/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis for General Circulation Model (GCM) validation. To co-register the NCEP/DOE reanalysis on the ISLSCP 1-degree grid, the reanalysis data set was regridded from its native T62 Gaussian grid) resolution (192 x 94 grid boxes globally) to 1-degree ISLSCP II required resolution.There are 136 compressed (.tar.gz) data files with this data set. When extrapolated, the individual data files are in ASCII (.asc) format.",

Soil data includes bulk density, class, texture, and measurements of carbon (C), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (mg), and potassium (K) concentrations.  Foliar data includes nitrogen (N), P, Ca, Mg, and K concentrations.The 17 pasture sites were cattle ranches selected within the region between Porto Velho and Presidente Medici of Rondonia. Four of the ranches with Ultisols support dairy cattle, and the rest have beef cattle pastures dispersed across three soil orders: Oxisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols.  Nearby primary forest sites were also sampled to provide data on the original soil properties for each soil order. Soil samples were collected in May 2003, July through August 2003, and May 2004, which covered the late rainy season (May) and the dry season (July through August). Grass species sampled included Brachiaria brizantha, Brachiaria decumbens, B. brizantha, and Pennestum clandestinum, and represented three phenologically distinct grass materials: wet-season live grass, collected in May 2004, dry-season live grass and dry-season senesced grass, both collected between the end of July and the beginning of August 2003.

Global peatland carbon balance was quantified using a) a continuous net carbon balance history throughout the Holocene derived from a data set of 64 dated peat cores, and b) global model simulations with the LPX-Bern model hindcasting the dynamics of past peatland distribution and carbon balance. CO2 emissions from land-use change are based on published scenarios for anthropogenic land use change (HYDE 3.1, HYDE 3.2, KK10) covering the last 10,000 years. This combination of model estimates with CO2 budget constraints narrows the range of past anthropogenic land use change emissions and their contribution to past carbon cycle changes.",

Vegetation height and density and diameter data are only provided for forested Atchafalaya sites during the spring collections. At the nine herbaceous wetland sites, a transect was established perpendicular to the wetland edge with replicate sample plots (0.25 m2, 5 m apart) located at 50, 100, and 150 m from the wetland edge to capture the range of vegetation structure, zonation, and composition.  AGB was harvested inside the duplicate plots at each sampling location. At the six forested wetland sites, duplicate circular plots (10 m radius, 50 m apart) were established inside the forest approximately 30 m from the wetland edge. All trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH at 1.3 m) &gt; 2.5 cm were measured within each plot and identified to species. The height of trees was measured with a laser range finder. AGB was estimated using species-specific allometric equations. Measurements were used to generate marsh and forested wetland coverage and biomass in response to seasonality within both basins. The data will be used to calibrate remote sensing data (e.g., UAVSAR, AVIRIS-NG) and hydrodynamics and sediment transport models.",

Field measurements were made during the Pre-Delta-X campaign on October 13-20, 2016. Relative water level measurements were recorded every five minutes during a one-week period using in situ pressure transducers (Solinst) to measure water surface elevation change with millimeter accuracy. The Solinst system combines a total pressure transducer (TPT) and a temperature detector. Once underwater, the TPT measures the sum of the atmosphere and water pressure above the sensor. Atmospheric pressure fluctuations must be accounted for to obtain the height of the water column above the TPT. An absolute elevation correction was applied to the water level data using an iterative approach with the USGS Calumet Station water level height and Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) lidar water level profiles. These Pre-Delta-X water level measurements served to calibrate and validate the campaign's remote sensing observations and hydrodynamic models.",

The VJ121C2 dataset is an 8-day composite LST&amp;E product at 0.05 degree (~5,600 meter) resolution that uses an algorithm based on a simple-averaging method and is formatted as a CMG for use in climate simulation models. The algorithm calculates the average from all the cloud-free VJ121A1D and VJ121A1N daily acquisitions from the 8-day period. Unlike the VJ121A1 datasets where the daytime and nighttime acquisitions are separate products, the VJ121C2 contains both daytime and nighttime acquisitions as separate science dataset (SDS) layers within a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file. The overall objective for NASA VIIRS products is to ensure the algorithms and products are compatible with the MODIS Terra and Aqua algorithms to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. Additional details regarding the method used to create this Level 3 (L3) product are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/product_documentation/vnp21_atbd.pdf.\r\n",

Burn sites included peatland and upland. These field data include vegetation inventories, ground cover, as well as diameter and height for trees and shrubs in the unburned sites. Similar data were collected for the unburned sites in the years 2015-18 and are available in related separate datasets. In 2019, the focus was on woody and non-woody seedling/sprouting regrowth data in the burned sites. Additional measurements collected at all sites included total peat depth, soil moisture, and active layer thickness (ALT). Soil moisture and ALT were collected for validation of the UAVSAR airborne collection and Radarsat-2 overpasses. This 2019 fieldwork completes five years of field sampling at the wildfire areas.",

    "description": "This data set includes the soil and vegetation characteristics, herbivore estimates, and precipitation measurement data for the 854 sites described and analyzed in Sankaran et al., 2005. Savannas are globally important ecosystems of great significance to human economies. In these biomes, which are characterized by the co-dominance of trees and grasses, woody cover is a chief determinant of ecosystem properties. The availability of resources (water, nutrients) and disturbance regimes (fire, herbivory) are thought to be important in regulating woody cover but perceptions differ on which of these are the primary drivers of savanna structure. Analyses of data from 854 sites across Africa (Figure 1) showed that maximum woody cover in savannas receiving a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of less than approximately 650 mm is constrained by, and increases linearly with, MAP. These arid and semi-arid savannas may be considered stable systems in which water constrains woody cover and permits grasses to coexist, while fire, herbivory and soil properties interact to reduce woody cover below the MAP-controlled upper bound. Above a MAP of approximately 650 mm, savannas are unstable systems in which MAP is sufficient for woody canopy closure, and disturbances (fire, herbivory) are required for the coexistence of trees and grass. These results provide insights into the nature of African savannas and suggest that future changes in precipitation may considerably affect their distribution and dynamics (Sankaran et al., 2005).This data set includes the site characteristics and measurement data for the 854 sites described and analyzed in Sankaran et al., 2005.  The data are provided in two formats, *.xls and *.csv. See the data format section below for more information.

The GCOM-W1 NRT AMSR2 Unified L2B Half-Orbit 25 km EASE-Grid Surface Soil Moisture product is a daily measurement of surface soil moisture produced by two retrieval algorithms using resampled Tb (Level-1R) data provided by JAXA: the Normalized Polarization Difference (NPD) algorithm developed by JPL and the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) developed by USDA.  Ancillary data include time, geolocation, and quality assessment.

    "description": "This dataset provides information on interannual trends in annual maximum vegetation greenness from 1985 to 2019 for recently undisturbed areas in the boreal forest biome. Multi-decadal changes in remotely sensed vegetation greenness provide evidence of an emerging boreal biome shift driven by climate warming. Annual maximum vegetation greenness was assessed at about 100,000 random sample locations using an ensemble of spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI2, kNDVI, and NIRv) derived from Landsat products. The dataset provides raster data summarizing vegetation greenness trends for sample locations stratified by Ecological Land Unit in GeoTIFF format. These raster data span the circum-hemispheric boreal forest biome between 45 to 70 degrees north at 300 m resolution. Estimates of uncertainty were generated using Monte Carlo simulations. Interannual trends in annual maximum vegetation greenness from 1985 to 2019 and 2000 to 2019 are provided for sample locations with adequate data for time series analysis; these data are in comma-separated values (CSV) format.",

The product contains only the CERES footprint in each scan that has the highest CALIPSO and CloudSat ground track coverage. The product consists of all cloud and aerosol properties derived from MODIS radiances included in the Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) product and computed irradiances included in the Cloud Radiative Swath (CRS) product. Two sets of SSF variables are included in the CCCM data. One set covers the entire CERES footprint and the other set is only over CALIOP and CPR ground track. CERES-derived top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave (SW), longwave (LW) and window (WN) irradiances by angular distribution models are also included. In addition, irradiance profiles computed by a radiative transfer model using MODIS, CALIOP, and CPR-derived aerosol, clouds, and surface properties are included in the product. Furthermore, MODIS-derived cloud properties from the algorithm that incorporates CALIOP and CPR cloud information are also included. \r\n\r\nMODIS-derived cloud properties and TOA irradiances derived from CERES radiances are produced by the same algorithm that produces CERES SSF and CRS products. However, the CCCM product should not be considered as a climate data record since various input data product versions and algorithm modifications will occur along the course of the measurement period. The scan and packet numbers unique to the CERES footprint provide the means to match the data to other CERES products, although the CCCM product contains more near nadir CERES footprints compared with SSF and CRS products. The resulting HDF granule contains 24 hours of data.CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program.

Data collection for this product is in progress.\r\n\r\nCERES Single Scanner Footprint One Degree (SSF1deg) Day provides daily averages of regional constant meteorology temporally interpolated TOA fluxes, clouds derived from a co-located imager and aerosols on a 1-degree latitude and longitude grid. This is a single satellite product that uses the primary CERES instrument in cross-track mode. TOA fluxes are provided for clear-sky and all-sky conditions for longwave (LW), shortwave (SW), and window (WN) wavelength bands. The incoming solar daily irradiance is from the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). The cloud properties are averaged for both day and night (24-hour) and day-only time periods. Cloud properties are stratified into 4 atmospheric layers (surface-700 hPa, 700 hPa - 500 hPa, 500 hPa - 300 hPa, 300 hPa - 100 hPa) and a total of all layers.

The Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC2000) was produced by an international partnership of 30 research groups coordinated by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which contained two levels of land cover information; detailed and regionally optimized land cover for each continent, and a less thematically detailed global land cover that harmonizes regions into one consistent product. The maps were based on daily data from the Vegetation 1 sensor on-board SPOT 4, though mapping of regions required the use of data from additional Earth observing sensors to resolve specific issues. The international and national protected areas were generated from the World Database of Protected Areas for the year 2000.",

Paved surfaces and built structures tend to absorb shortwave radiation from the sun and release long-wave radiation after a lag of a few hours. The Global Urban Heat Island (UHI) Data Set, 2013, estimates the land surface temperature within urban areas in degrees Celsius (average summer daytime maximum and average summer nighttime minimum) as well as the difference between those temperatures and the temperatures in surrounding rural areas, defined as a 10km buffer around the urban extent.

Spatial urban land projections are key inputs for the analysis of land use, energy use, and emissions, as well as for the assessment of climate change vulnerability, impacts and adaptation. This data set presents a set of global, spatially explicit urban land scenarios that are consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to produce an empirically-grounded set of urban land spatial distributions over the 21st century. A data-science approach is used exploiting 15 diverse data sets, including a newly available 40-year global time series of fine-spatial-resolution remote sensing observations from the Landsat satellite series. The SSPs are developed to support future climate and global change research, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), along with Special Reports.",

An algorithm was developed and validated to downscale the 1/8-degree resolution data set to 1-km resolution. For a given decade, the downscaling algorithm allocates the 1/8-degree decadal amount of urban land expansion to 1-km grid cells in proportion to their total urban land amounts at the beginning of the decade. The algorithm uses an iterative process to collect any overflows from already highly-developed 1-km grid cells, and then allocates them to 1-km grid cells that are not yet fully developed. This iterative process repeats itself until all 1/8-degree amounts of urban land expansion are allocated to 1-km grid cells with no overflow. The downscaling process is applied decade by decade throughout the 21st century for each urban land expansion scenario. The final product is a set of global maps displaying the 1-km fraction of urban land, updated at decadal intervals throughout the 21st century, for five different urban land expansion scenarios consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).",

Each paper was then coded along a number of different dimensions, including categories of types of papers or analysis, number of subcategories for SSP Applications and SSP Extensions, particular Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) used, particular Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) used, and particular SSP-RCP combinations used. Over the past ten years, the climate change research commUnity developed a scenario framework combining alternative futures of climate and society to facilitate integrated research and consistent assessment to inform policy. This framework consists of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and Shared Policy Assumptions (SPAs), which together describe alternative visions of how society and climate may evolve over the coming decades, while providing a framework for combining these pathways in integrated studies. The tracking of the use of this framework in the literature allows for assessment of how it is being used, whether it is achieving its original goals, and what improvements to the framework would benefit future research.",

    "description": "The Global Man-made Impervious Surface (GMIS) Dataset From Landsat consists of global estimates of fractional impervious cover derived from the Global Land Survey (GLS) Landsat dataset for the target year 2010. The GMIS dataset consists of two components: 1) global percent of impervious cover; and 2) per-pixel associated uncertainty for the global impervious cover. These layers are co-registered to the same spatial extent at a common 30m spatial resolution. The spatial extent covers the entire globe except Antarctica and some small islands. This dataset is one of the first global, 30m datasets of man-made impervious cover to be derived from the GLS data for 2010 and is a companion dataset to the Global Human Built-up And Settlement Extent (HBASE) dataset. The dataset is expected to have a rather broad spectrum of users, from those wishing to examine/study the fine details of urban land cover over the globe at full 30m resolution to global modelers trying to understand the climate/environmental impacts of man-made surfaces at continental to global scales. For example, the data are applicable to local modeling studies of urban impacts on the energy, water, and carbon cycles, as well as analyses at the individual country level.",

The flux estimates were spatially distributed to a global 0.05-degree resolution grid using MODIS land cover data. The quantities of carbon flux in each gridcell are represented in two ways: (1) where the quantities of carbon distributed to each gridcell were divided by the total gridcell area, resulting in average carbon fluxes per unit of total area (g C/m2/yr), and (2), where annual carbon fluxes associated with a source were summed over all types for the gridcell (Mg C/yr). The total surface area of the grid cells is provided.There are eight data files in netCDF format (.nc4) with this data set -- two files (per area and per gridcell) for each of the four flux source types.

    "description": "Declassified satellite images provide an important worldwide record of land-surface change. With the success of the first release of classified satellite photography in 1995, images from U.S. military intelligence satellites KH-7 and KH-9 were declassified in accordance with Executive Order 12951 in 2002. The data were originally used for cartographic information and reconnaissance for U.S. intelligence agencies. Since the images could be of historical value for global change research and were no longer critical to national security, the collection was made available to the public.\n\nKeyhole (KH) satellite systems KH-7 and KH-9 acquired photographs of the Earth’s surface with a telescopic camera system and transported the exposed film through the use of recovery capsules. The capsules or buckets were de-orbited and retrieved by aircraft while the capsules parachuted to earth. The exposed film was developed and the images were analyzed for a range of military applications.\n\nThe KH-7 surveillance system was a high resolution imaging system that was operational from July 1963 to June 1967. Approximately 18,000 black-and-white images and 230 color images are available from the 38 missions flown during this program. Key features for this program were larger area of coverage and improved ground resolution. The cameras acquired imagery in continuous lengthwise sweeps of the terrain. KH-7 images are 9 inches wide, vary in length from 4 inches to 500 feet long, and have a resolution of 2 to 4 feet.\n\nThe KH-9 mapping program was operational from March 1973 to October 1980 and was designed to support mapping requirements and exact positioning of geographical points for the military. This was accomplished by using image overlap for stereo coverage and by using a camera system with a reseau grid to correct image distortion. The KH-9 framing cameras produced 9 x 18 inch imagery at a resolution of 20-30 feet. Approximately 29,000 mapping images were acquired from 12 missions. \n\nThe original film sources are maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Duplicate film sources held in the USGS EROS Center archive are used to produce digital copies of the imagery.",

    "description": "This dataset includes high-resolution (~5 m) gridded estimates of herbaceous aboveground biomass (AGB) for the Atchafalaya and Terrebonne basins of the Mississippi River Delta in coastal Louisiana, USA, for the fall and spring seasons of 2021. AGB, quantified as dry biomass in Mg per hectare, was estimated from Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-adjusted surface reflectance products from NASA's Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) acquired over the study area in April and August 2021. The BRDF-adjusted reflectance was derived from hemispherical-directional surface reflectance with atmospheric correction. A machine learning model to estimate AGB was generated by comparing local pixel reflectance spectra with coincident in-situ samples of herbaceous vegetation AGB. This model was then scaled to the AVIRIS-NG mosaic imagery to map herbaceous AGB across the Atchafalaya and Terrebonne Basins. The Delta-X campaign conducted both airborne (remote sensing) and field (in situ) measurements to measure hydrology, water quality (e.g., total suspended solids (TSS)), and vegetation structure. These data serve to better understand rates of soil erosion, accretion, and creation in the delta system, with the goal of building better models of how river deltas will behave under relative sea level rise. The data are provided in cloud optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format. This Version 2 dataset replaces the files provided in Version 1.",

    "description": "This dataset contains water surface elevations at selected point locations generated from the AirSWOT data collected during the Spring and Fall 2021 Delta-X deployments over the Atchafalaya and Terrebonne basins in Louisiana, USA. AirSWOT uses near-nadir wide-swath Ka-band radar interferometry to measure water-surface elevation and produce continuous gridded elevation data. The Level 3 (L3) data were created by masking land areas out of the AirSWOT Level 2 products, then filtering and averaging to the AirSWOT heights to produce water surface elevations at selected points throughout the scene. The AirSWOT elevation data are useful for calibrating elevation and slopes along the main channels, as well as tying observations to open ocean tidal conditions. AirSWOT performance in the floodplain was limited by the presence of vegetation and the very small slope characteristic of two dimensional floodplain discharge. Therefore, the bulk of the AirSWOT data collections were targeted at the larger channels, since the channel discharge provides the necessary boundary conditions for potential overflow to islands and floodplains. The data are provided in comma-separated values (CSV) format.",

Water-level change observations are provided throughout wetlands of the Atchafalaya and Terrebonne Basins, in Southern Louisiana, USA, within the Mississippi River Delta (MRD). The data were collected by Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), a polarimetric L-band synthetic aperture radar flown on the NASA Gulfstream-III (C20) aircraft as part of the Delta-X campaign. Water surface elevations were measured on multiple flights at 30-minute intervals. There are three types of gridded products available: temporalcoherence (which provide an index measuring quality of phase unwrapping ranging from 0 (poor) to 1 (correctly unwrapped)), waterlevelchange in centimeters (which provide cumulative changes in water levels at approximately 30-minute intervals), and waterlevelchange_ramp in centimeters (which provide a 2-dimensional linear trend in water-level estimates not related to changing water levels). The water-level change maps were estimated using the phase unwrapping corrected interferograms generated for nearest-neighbor (NN), NN+1, and NN+2 pairs for data acquired within a single flight (one day). This analysis was done for all flight lines. Water level changes are relative to the first sampling flight for that study area. Data quality was assessed by comparing water elevation estimates with data from in situ water level gauges throughout the study area.",

EMIT is installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and uses imaging spectroscopy to take measurements of the sunlit regions of interest between 52° N latitude and 52° S latitude. An interactive map showing the regions being investigated, current and forecasted data coverage, and additional data resources can be found on the VSWIR Imaging Spectroscopy Interface for Open Science (VISIONS) EMIT Open Data Portal.\r\nThe EMIT Level 3 Aggregated Mineral Spectral Abundance and Uncertainty (EMITL3ASA) Version 1 data product provides an aggregated mineral spectral abundance of the 10 minerals that are the focus of the EMIT mission. These minerals, referred to as the EMIT-10 minerals, are calcite, chlorite, dolomite, goethite, gypsum, hematite, illite+muscovite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, and vermiculite. The EMITL3ASA granule consists of one network Common Data Format 4 (netCDF-4) file at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees. The data in EMITL3ASA relies heavily on the EMIT L2B Estimated Mineral Identification and Band Depth and Uncertainty (EMITL2BMIN) data. Using the EMITL2BMIN data, aggregated spectral abundance (ASA) is calculated for each of the EMIT-10 minerals as the simple average of relevant 60 m pixels within each 0.5 degree grid cell in the EMITL3ASA product, after controlling for the estimated fractional cover of bare soil within the pixel. \r\nThe EMITL3ASA data product contains 20 Science Dataset (SDS) layers.

    "description": "FLASH_SSF_NOAA20-FM6-VIIRS_Version1A data are near real-time CERES observed TOA fluxes, clouds, and parameterized surface fluxes, not officially calibrated. The Fast Longwave and SHortwave Flux (FLASHFlux) data are a product line of the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) project designed for processing and release of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative fluxes within one week of CERES instrument measurement. The FLASHFlux data product is a rapid release product based upon the algorithms developed for and data collected by the CERES project. CERES is currently producing world-class climate data products derived from measurements taken aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua spacecrafts. While of exceptional fidelity, these data products require a considerable amount of processing time to assure quality, verify accuracy, and assess precision. The result is that CERES data are typically released up to six months after acquisition of the initial measurements. For climate studies, such delays are of little consequence especially considering the improved quality of the released data products. Thus, FLASHFlux products are not intended to achieve climate quality.FLASHFlux data products were envisioned as a resource whereby CERES data could be provided to the community within a week of the initial measurements, with some calibration accuracy requirements relaxed to gain speed. The Single Scanner Footprint TOA/Surface Fluxes and Clouds (SSF) product contains one hour of instantaneous Fast Longwave And SHortwave Fluxes (FLASHFlux) data for a single Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) scanner instrument. The SSF combines instantaneous CERES data with scene information from a higher-resolution imager such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the NOAA-20 satellite and meteorological and ozone information from the GEOS-5 FP-IT Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (GEOS-5 ADAS). Scene identification and cloud properties are defined at the higher imager resolution and these data are averaged over the larger CERES footprint. For each CERES footprint, the SSF contains Top-of-Atmosphere fluxes in SW, LW, and incoming NET, surface fluxes using the Langley parameterized shortwave and longwave algorithms, and clouds information.CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES mission is a follow on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. CERES instrument (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The latest CERES instrument (Fm6) was launched on board NOAA-20 on November 18, 2017.",

This mosaic was planned in July 1995 as an activity of the EOS-IDS Project that was developed with cooperation among INPE, CENA, University of Washington in Seattle (UW), University of California in Santa Barbara (UCSB), and NASA. The mosaic is composed by 29 Landsat TM images covering a period from 1986 to 1995 that were selected with minimum cloud cover and within the July to September high water season of the Amazon River. These images were geometrically corrected using ground control points extracted from topographic charts and image charts at the 1:250,000 scale. In addition, these images were radiometrically rectified to 231/062 (Manaus region) TM image using the method developed by Hall et al. (1991). The radiometric rectification applied had a good performance for bands 3, 5, and 7, for most of the scenes. For bands 1 and 2 the radiometric rectification was limited, especially for scenes with intense haze. Nevertheless, the overall performance of radiometric normalization allowed the production of a uniform data set for the entire Brazilian Amazon River mainstem floodplain. The mosaic was then built using the best bands (rectified or non-rectified) of the TM images with 90 meter spatial resolution. The mosaic data are provided in geoTIFF-formatted files, rectified and geocoded, for six TM bands (1 to 5 and 7) with 90-meter spatial resolution. The mosaic is divided in two parts: Part 1, from the mouth of the Amazon river in Brazil to the Brazil/Peru boundary and Part 2, from the Brazil/Peru boundary to its spring.There is also a 500-meter resolution mosaic covering all the Amazon river (from spring to the mouth) with geoTIFF-formatted data files for TM bands 3, 4, and 5. The processed, quality controlled and integrated data in the documented Pre-LBA Data sets were originally published as a set of three CD_ROMs (Marengo and Victoria, 1998) but are now archived individually.

As the instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth's surface below is successively imaged by all 9 cameras, in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the fate of sunlight in Earth environment, as well as distinguish different types of clouds, particles and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation canopy structure. MISR Level 2 Land Surface Product subset for the GoMACCS region V002 contains information on land directional reflectance properties; albedos (spectral and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) integrated); fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR); associated radiation parameters; and terrain-referenced geometric parameters.",

An orthoimage is a uniform-scale image where corrections have been made for feature displacement such as building tilt and for scale variations caused by terrain relief, sensor geometry, and camera tilt. A mathematical equation based on ground control points, sensor calibration information, and a digital elevation model is applied to each pixel to rectify the image to obtain the geometric qualities of a map.\n\nA digital orthoimage may be created from several photographs mosaicked to form the final image. The source imagery may be black-and-white, natural color, or color infrared with a pixel resolution of 1-meter or finer. With orthoimagery, the resolution refers to the distance on the ground represented by each pixel.\n",

All of the data have been processed to the same global spatial resolution (1 deg. x 1 deg.), using the same land/sea mask and steps have been taken to ensure spatial and temporal continuity of the data. The data sets cover the period 1987-1988 at 1-month time resolution for most of the seasonally varying quantities. For this pre-LBA data set, the ISLSCP I data are provided as global coverages. The companion file illustrations were subset over the LBA study area, from 35-85 deg. W longitude and 20 deg. S to 10 deg. N latitude, as shown in Figure 1.The data files and illustrations are organized into the three groups listed below.1. Hydrology and Soils2. Radiation and Clouds3. VegetationThe data within each of these areas were acquired from a variety of sources including model output, satellites, and ground measurements. The individual data sets were provided in a variety of forms. In some cases, this required the data publication team to regrid and reformat data sets and in others to produce monthly averages from finer resolution data. The specific processing for each data set is detailed in the documentation. The processed, quality controlled and integrated data in the documented Pre-LBA Data sets were originally published as a set of three CD-ROMs (Marengo and Victoria, 1998) but are now archived individually.

It forms a complement to the historical croplands data set developed by Ramankutty and Foley (1999). By overlaying the two, one can determine the extent to which natural vegetation has been cleared for cultivation. This data set can be used directly within spatially-explicit climate and biogeochemical models. There are four total files in this data set. Two files contain the land cover types representing potential natural vegetation before human alteration, and two other files contain those points in the original data set submitted by the Principal Investigator that have been modified in order to match the land/water mask of the ISLSCP Initiative II.The geographic distribution of contemporary land cover types can be derived from remotely-sensed data. However, humans now dominate much of the world and there is little evidence of the pre-human-settlement natural vegetation or Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV). PNV, as defined here, does not necessarily represent the world's natural pre-human-disturbance vegetation. Rather, our definition of PNV represents the world's vegetation cover that would most likely exist now in equilibrium with present-day climate and natural disturbance, in the absence of human activities.",

    "description": "Active layer thickness (ALT) is a critical parameter for monitoring the status of permafrost that is typically measured at specific locations using probing, in situ temperature sensors, or other ground-based observations. The thickness of the active layer is the average annual thaw depth, in permafrost areas, due to solar heating of the surface. This data set includes the mean Remotely Sensed Active Layer Thickness (ReSALT) over years 1992 to 2000 for an area near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. The data were produced by an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique that measures seasonal surface subsidence and infers ALT. ReSALT estimates were validated by comparison with ground-based ALT measurements at multiple sites. These results indicate remote sensing techniques based on InSAR could be an effective way to measure and monitor ALT over large areas on the Arctic coastal plain.These data provide gridded (100-m) estimates of active layer thickness (cm; ALT), seasonal subsidence (cm) and subsidence trend (mm/yr), as well as calculated uncertainty in each of these parameters. This data set was developed in support  of NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) field campaign.The data are presented in one netCDF (*.nc) file. ",

    "description": "Culminating more than four years of processing data, NASA and the  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) have completed Earth's  most  extensive global topographic map. The mission is a collaboration among NASA, NGA, and the German and Italian space agencies. For 11 days in February 2000,  the space shuttle Endeavour conducted the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission  (SRTM) using C-Band and X-Band interferometric synthetic aperture radars to  acquire topographic data over 80% of  the Earth's land mass, creating the first-ever near-global data set of land elevations.  This data was used to produce topographic maps (digital elevation maps) 30  times as precise as the best global maps used today.  The SRTM   system gathered    data at the rate of 40,000 per minute over land.  They reveal for the first time large, detailed swaths of Earth's topography previously  obscured by  persistent cloudiness. The data will benefit scientists, engineers, government agencies and the public with an ever-growing array of uses. The SRTM radar system mapped Earth from 56 degrees south to 60 degrees  north of the equator. The resolution of the publicly available data is three arc-seconds (1/1,200th of a degree of latitude and longitude, about  295 feet, at Earth's equator).  The final data release covers Australia and New Zealand in unprecedented uniform detail. It also covers more than 1,000 islands     comprising much of Polynesia and Melanesia in the South Pacific, as    well as islands in  the South Indian and Atlantic oceans.  SRTM data are being used for applications ranging from land use planning  to \"virtual\" Earth exploration.    Currently, the mission's homepage \"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm\" provides direct  access to recently obtained earth images.   The Shuttle Radar  Topography Mission C-band  data for North America and South America are available to the public.  A list of complete public data set is available at \"http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/dataprod.htm\"  The data specifications are within the following parameters:  30-meter X 30-meter spatial sampling with 16 meter absolute vertical height  accuracy,  10-meter relative vertical height accuracy, and 20-meter absolute horizontal  circular accuracy.  From the JPL Mission Products Summary,   \"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/dataprelimdescriptions.html\". The primary products of the SRTM mission are the digital elevation maps of most of the Earth's surface.  Visualized images of these maps are available for viewing online. Below you will find descriptions of the types of images that  are being generated:       \n      \n-  Radar Image              \n-  Radar Image with Color as Height             \n-  Radar Image with Color Wrapped Fringes             \n-Shaded Relief              \n-  Perspective View with B/W Radar Image Overlaid  \n-  Perspective View with Radar Image Overlaid, Color as Height      \n-  Perspective View of Shaded Relief              \n-  Perspective View\nwith Landsat or other Image Overlaid              \n-  Contour Map - B/W with Contour Lines              \n-  Stereo Pair             \n-  Anaglypgh            \n\nThe SRTM radar contained two types of antenna panels, C-band and X-band. The near-global topographic maps of Earth called Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are made from the C-band radar data.  These data were processed at  the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory and are being distributed through the United States  Geological Survey's EROS Data Center. Data from the X-band radar are used to create slightly higher resolution DEMs  but without the global coverage of the C-band radar. The SRTM X-band radar data are being processed and distributed by the German Aerospace Center, DLR.\n",

Reported in five ASCII files are (1) the initial values of soil and plant litter macronutrients, nitrogen; and carbon contents; (2) descriptions of the various experimental treatments; and (3) the final nitrogen and carbon composition of the plant litter and soil and calculated releases from the litter.The study was conducted at the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria-Centro da Pesquisa Agroflorestal (EMBRAPA-CPAA) experimental station located north of Manaus on the BR 174 highway in the central Amazon Basin. The experimental plot, located in an open grassy field, was selected based on low, homogeneous soil C and nutrient contents, minimal prior disturbance, and no previous fertilizer application. The soil was a degraded typic Hapludox with the following soil properties for the upper 0-3 cm: pH in water of 5.05, 1.3 mg N/g, 18.0 mg C/g (automatic CN Analyzer, Elementar), 2.05 mg P/kg, 55.0 mg K/kg (Mehlich-1 extractable), 11.7 mg Ca/kg, and 4.6 mg Mg/kg (KCl extractable). The experiment was conducted in the field in small plots with treatments that vary in the ratio of plant litter of two plants: gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth. ex Walp.) and cupuacu (Theobroma grandiflorum). Soil and litter samples were collected prior to and during the experiment. Resin bags were used to retain mineral nitrogen released from the plant litter.",

This data set contains 12 comma-delimited ASCII data files.Hot pixel data from satellites can be used as an indicator of fires and for the understanding of fire frequency in remote areas. The publication by Vasconcelos and Brown, 2007, which has been included as a companion file, describes the application of these data in the MAP region. In addition to the the hot pixel data, each observation has a derived vegetation type, susceptibility to fire, recent and past precipitation amounts, and a calculated fire risk value.

    "description": "This data set contains 5-minute land use maps for agricultural activity in Amazonia. The data set was produced by the statistical fusion of agricultural census data from Brazil,Columbia, Bolivia, and Peru with the land cover data product from the Global Land Cover Facility. These land use maps indicate the estimated total amount of cropland and pasture (natural and planted) for the Amazon and Tocantins River basins in 1995 and 1980 and are suitable for use in models or other similar purposes. Data are provided in the netCDF format and the ARC/INFO GRID ASCII format.The 1995 data were generated from a fusion of agricultural census data and a satellite classification, and are described in Cardille, Foley, and Costa (2002).  The fusion technique merges agricultural census data from Brazil, Columbia, Peru, and Bolivia with land cover data from the University of Maryland Global Land Cover Facility 1-km classification. This technique was used to derive an estimate of the mid-1990s total agriculture surface for the region, which was then apportioned according to agriculture census data into cultivated area, natural pasture, and planted pasture.The 1980 maps, including only the Brazilian portion of the Amazon/Tocantins river drainage basins, were created by scaling the mid-1990s snapshots backward in time using the relative increase or decrease in agriculture, as derived from mid-1980s census data and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data (Cardille and Foley, 2003).",

    "description": "This data set reports basic soil structure and composition information for five Amazonian research sites: Altamira, Bragantina, Tome-Acu, and Ponta de Pedras, all four in the state of Para, Brazil; and one site in Yapu, Colombia. Soil characteristics reported for all five study sites include cation information (e.g., H, Al, Mg, K, Na, S), percent of soil C, N, and organic matter, soil texture/composition and color, pH, and land use history. Soil bulk density and tons of carbon/ha are reported for only three of the study sites: Altamira, Bragantina, and Tome-Acu. All of the data are provided in one comma-separated data file.The five study areas represent characteristic differences in soil fertility and a range of land uses typical of the Amazon region. One of these areas, Altamira, is characterized by above average pH, nutrients, and texture. The other four areas are more typical of the 75 percent of the Amazon that is characterized by Oxisols and Ultisols, with well-drained but low pH and low levels of nutrients. Ponta de Pedras in Marajo Island, located in the estuary, is composed of upland Oxisols and floodplain alluvial soils. Igarape-Acu in the Bragantina region is characterized by both nutrient-poor Spodosols and Oxisols. Tome-Acu, south of Igarape-Acu, represents a mosaic of Oxisols and Ultisols. Yapu, in the Colombian Vaupes, is composed of patches of Spodosols and Oxisols. Three of the areas are colonization regions at various degrees of development: Altamira is a colonization front that opened up in 1971, whereas Tome-Acu was settled by a Japanese population in the 1930s, and Bragantina was settled in the early part of the twentieth century. Marajo (Ponta de Pedras) is the home of caboclos, whereas Yapu is home to Tukanoan Native American populations. In these study areas  slash-and-burn cultivation as well as plantation agriculture and mechanized agriculture are employed. Length of fallows vary in these communities. The two indigenous areas leave their land in longer fallow than do the three colonization areas, and the proportion of land prepared from secondary forests increases with length of settlement as the stock of mature forest declines over time.",

    "description": "This data set contains two image mosaics of L-band radar backscatter and two image mosaics of first order texture. The two backscatter images are mosaics of L-band Radar Backscatter at Horizontal-Horizontal (HH) Polarization created from 1,500 images collected by the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) over the Amazon River Basin as part of the Global Rainforest Mapping Project (GRMP). These backscatter image mosaics were developed using data collected over 62 days from August to November of 1995 for the peak of the dry season and for 62 days from May to June of 1996 during the peak of the wet season. The two image mosaics are at 3 arc-sec resolution. Data provided under this project are resampled images at 30 arc-sec resolution (or about 1 km resolution). For each radar backscatter image, first order texture statistical information was derived and is distributed along with the image mosaic.This data set contains four images each in both geotiff and ENVI formats, provided in eight zip files.  The four files in ENVI file format contain o_envi? in their file name and when extrapolated contain an envi image (*_envi.dat) and an envi image header file (_envi.hdr).

    "description": "This data set contains proportional estimates for the vegetative cover types of woody vegetation, herbaceous vegetation, and bare ground over the Amazon Basin for the period 2000-2001. These products were derived from all seven bands of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard NASA's Terra satellite. A set of MODIS 32-day composites were used to create the vegetation cover types using the Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) (Hansen et al., 2002) approach which shows how much of a land cover such as \"forest\" or \"grassland\" exists anywhere on the land surface.  The VCF product may depict areas of heterogeneous land cover better than traditional discrete classification schemes which shows where land cover types are concentrated.The original MODIS products are 500-m spatial resolution and are derived from 2000-2001 data products. The data were resampled to 1-km resolution for the regional study under this project, and provided as 3 separate cover type files in ENVI and GeoTIFF file formats that are provided in six zipped files.

    "description": "This image was collected by the Hyperion sensor on 10-July-2004 at 13:16:16 GMT.  It was calibrated to apparent surface reflectance using the ACORN atmospheric model.The Hyperion imager has a spectral range of 400-2500 nm, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, spatial resolution of 30 m, and a swath width of 7.8 km. Sampling is scene based (256 samples, 512 lines) (http://eo1.usgs.gov/sensors.php).  Through these large number of spectral bands, complex land ecosystems can be imaged and accurately classified.Data from the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer may greatly increase our ability to estimate the presence and structural attributes of selective logging in the Amazon Basin using four biogeophysical indicators not yet derived simultaneously from any satellite sensor: 1) green canopy leaf area index; 2) degree of shadowing; 3) presence of exposed soil and; 4) non-photosynthetic vegetation material. Airborne, field and modeling studies have shown that the optical reflectance continuum (400-2500 nm) contains sufficient information to derive estimates of each of these indicators. Our ongoing studies in the eastern Amazon basin also suggest that these four indicators are sensitive to logging intensity. Satellite-based estimates of these indicators should provide a means to quantify both the presence and degree of structural disturbance caused by various logging regimes.",

Collection 5 used only four observations per day.\r\n*\tThe MCD43 products use L2G-lite surface reflectance as input.\r\n*\tWhen there are insufficient high quality reflectances, a database with archetypal BRDF parameters is used to supplement the observational data and perform a lower quality magnitude inversion. This database is continually updated with the latest full inversion retrieval for each pixel.\r\n*\tCMG Albedo is estimated using all the clear-sky observations within the 1,000 m grid for MCD43D as opposed to aggregating from the 500 m albedo.\r\n\r\nImportant Quality Information\r\nThe incorrect representation of the aerosol quantities (low average high) in the C6 MYD09 and MOD09 surface reflectance products may have impacted down stream products particularly over arid bright surfaces (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD09&amp;caseNum=PM_MOD09_20010&amp;caseLocation=cases_data&amp;type=C6). This (and a few other issues) have been corrected for C6.1. Therefore users should avoid substantive use of the C6 MCD43 products and wait for the C6.1 products. In any event, users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in MCD43A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QAs provided as part of the MCD43A1, 3, and 4 products.\r\n",

The original MAIAC reflectance data were corrected to consistent view and illumination angles (0 degree view zenith angle and 45 degree of sun zenith angle) using two independent algorithms: the first based on the original BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) parameters provided by the MAIAC team, and the second based on a machine learning approach (random forests). The corrected data preserve the original MAIAC data's sub-daily temporal resolution and 1 km spatial resolution with seven land bands (bands 1-7) and five ocean bands (bands 8-12). The resulting tower site sub-daily timeseries of angular corrected surface reflectances are suitable for long-term studies on patterns, processes, and dynamics of surface phenomena.",

    "description": "The Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) project was established to provide multi-resolution land cover data of the conterminous United States from local to regional scales.  A major component of MRLC is an objective to develop a national 30-meter land cover characteristics data base using Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data.  This is a cooperative effort among six programs within four U.S. Government agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program; the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water Quality Assessment Program; the National Biological Service's Gap Analysis Program; the USGS' Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) Center; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal Change Analysis Program; and the EPA's North American Landscape Characterization project.\n\nMultitemporal scenes were selected for the eastern deciduous forests, agricultural regions, and selected other regions.  Multitemporal pairs were selected to be in consecutive seasons (in 1992 when possible).  All scenes were previewed for image quality.\n\nThe participating agencies organized the joint purchase of a single national set of Landsat TM scenes.  In addition, the cooperators developed a common definition for preprocessing the satellite data.  The shared, consistently processed TM data are the foundation for the development of the national 30-meter land cover data base.  The jointly acquired data are archived and distributed by EROS.  A variety of products are available to MRLC participants, to their affiliated users, and to the general public.\n\nMulti-Resolution Land Characterization 2001 (MRLC 2001) At-Sensor Reflectance Dataset is a second-generation federal consortium to create an updated pool of nation-wide Landsat imagery, and derive a second-generation National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001).\n\nThe MRLC 2001 data cover the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. Multi-temporal scenes may also be available, depending on the location. Most of the images are of high quality, and cloud cover is generally less than ten percent. The data will also include a 30-meter Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for all scenes that do not include the Canadian or Mexican borders.",

Ground-based crop canopy reflectance was measured at 5.4 m above the corn and soybean canopy using hyperspectral radiometers (range 400 to 1100 nm) during the growing season from May to October in eight different years (2001-2008).

Spectral bands from Landsat TM and ETM+, MERIS , and MODIS instruments were used to calculate vegetation indices. Vegetation indices related to chlorophyll can be used as a proxy for GPP because of the observed close relationship between GPP and Chl content in crops.

The temporal ranges of the data are sufficient for carbon cycle model simulations from 1801 to 2010. These data were compiled specifically for the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Multi-Scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) as the prescribed model input driver data (Huntzinger et al., 2013). The driver data were used by 22 terrestrial biosphere models to run baseline and sensitivity simulations. The standardized data provided consistent model inputs to minimize the inter-model variability caused by differences in environmental drivers and initial conditions. Together with the sensitivity simulations, the standardized input data enable better interpretation and quantification of structural and parameter uncertainties of model estimates.

The NALC project is a cooperative effort between NASA, the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Geological Survey to make Landsat data available to the  widest possible user community for scientific research and for the general public interest.  The objectives of the NALC project are to develop standardized remotely sensed data sets and analysis methods in support of investigations of changes in land cover, to  develop inventories of terrestrial carbon stocks, to assess carbon cycling dynamics, and to map terrestrial sources of greenhouse gas (CO, CO2, CH4, and N2) emissions. The NALC data set is comprised of hundreds of triplicates (i.e., multispectral scanner (MSS) data acquired in the years 1973, 1986, and 1991 plus or minus 1 year, thus, the name triplicate).  The NALC triplicates also include digital elevation model data.  The specific temporal windows vary for geographical regions based on the seasonal characteristics of the vegetation cover.  In accordance with the Landsat  Pathfinder Program concept, the Pathfinder basic data sets are to be comprised of data which have had systematic radiometric and systematic geometric corrections applied to them.  The NALC triplicates, however, are precision corrected for geocoding purposes.\n",

These continental forest age maps were compiled from forest inventory data, historical fire data, optical satellite data, and the images from the NASA Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) project. These input data products have various sources and creation dates as described in the source paper by Pan et al. (2011). Canadian maps were produced with data available through 2004 and U.S.A. maps with data available through 2006. A supplementary map of the standard deviations for age estimates was developed for quantifying uncertainty.Note that the Pan et al. (2011) paper is included as a companion file with this data set and was the source of descriptions in the guide.Forest age, implicitly reflecting the past disturbance legacy, is a simple and direct surrogate for the time since disturbance and may be used in various forest carbon analyses that concern the impact of disturbances. By combining geographic information about forest age with estimated carbon dynamics by forest type, it is possible to conduct a simple but powerful analysis of the net CO2 uptake by forests, and the potential for increasing (or decreasing) this rate as a result of direct human intervention in the disturbance/age status.",

Deforestation maps were determined for the main agricultural and surrounding forested areas of Rondonia using multiple Landsat TM scenes (Biggs et al. 2008). Cumulative deforestation estimates were derived from this time series of Landsat scenes from 1975 to 1999. To obtain watershed-level estimates of deforestation, watershed boundaries and stream networks were delineated by a flow accumulation algorithm using a 90-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The results were watersheds of seven Strahler stream orders (1-7) with stream networks that closely matched those of the 1:100,000 topographic maps for the area. The watershed boundaries, classified by stream order, were overlain on the time series of deforestation maps to determine the cumulative deforestation extent in 1999. This data set contains six ESRI ArcGIS shapefiles of the watershed boundaries for streams orders 2-7, the smallest watershed (second order) to the largest inclusive watershed (seventh order).

    "description": "This data set provides measurements of soil properties compiled from 39 studies on nutrient dynamics in natural forests and forest-derived land uses (pasture, shifting cultivation and tree plantations) conducted in Amazonia over the period of 1950-2001. The initial literature survey for the data consisted of more than 100 studies conducted during this period.The objectives of this project were to compare soil data from major land uses across Amazonia and identify gaps in present knowledge that offer direction for future research. Five widely cited hypotheses were tested concerning the effects of land-use change on soil properties by analyzing data compiled from 39 studies in multi-factorial ANOVA models:-- effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), and exchangeable calcium (Ca) concentrations rise and remain elevated following the slash-and-burn conversion of forest to pasture or crop fields soil contents of total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and inorganic readily (i.e., Bray, Mehlich I or resin) extractable phosphorus (Pi) decline following forest-to-pasture conversion-- soil concentrations of total C, N, and Pi increase in secondary forests with time since abandonment from agricultural activities-- soil nutrient conditions under all tree-dominated land-use systems (natural or not) remain the same-- higher efficiencies of nutrient utilization occur where soil nutrient pools are lower There is one comma-delimited ASCII file (.csv) with this data set and a list of the 39 studies used in this data set provided as a companion file in text format.",

Sample locations were randomly selected from stratified regions of the 1,400 ha Block 5 to account for local scale soil variability. Soil samples were collected to 8-m depth in (1) nine gaps formed by single tree removal and (2) nine areas of undisturbed primary forest. Areas of undisturbed forest were confined to patches of forest within Block 5 that were protected from logging.  An additional 3 forested areas were sampled to 3-m depth that contained high sand content. These results quantified the effects of reduced impact logging, to test whether nitrogen (N) loss from leaves and coarse woody debris under reduced impact logging results in a significant accumulation of subsoil nitrate (Feldpausch et al., 2009). One comma separated data file contains the soil moisture results and a second file the soil NO3 content and soil physical properties.",

Samples were collected from an approximately 20 x 20 m grid over each watershed from 2004/05/01 to 2004/08/18. By sampling each location at depths of 0-20 and 40-60 cm it was possible to distinguish and map the principle soil classes found in the study area to the 2nd category level of the Brazilian System of Soil Classification (Cooper et al., 2005) associated with the topographic relief. The data set contains one comma separated ASCII data file with spatially referenced soil nutrient and organic carbon data from 0-20 cm (A layer, topsoil) and 40-60 cm (B layer, subsoil)depths for the Juruena watersheds study area.A satisfactory relationship between the redness index of the diagnostic horizons and the soil class colors was also found. In spite of the apparent homogeneity of the visible landscape characteristics such as slope, soil color, and vegetation, the carbon and soil clay attributes were found to vary greatly. This variability over small distances demonstrates that extrapolation of soil characteristics and soil carbon stocks to larger areas could produce erroneous results if the spatial variability of the soil attributes is not taken into consideration.",

    "title": "LBA-ECO ND-11 Soil Water Pressure and Flow Measurements under Tree Crops",
    "description": "This data set contains information that can be used to examine water fluxes in soils beneath tree crops in an Amazonian agroforest. The data consists of repeated measurements of soil matrix pressure and soil moisture content at several depths. The study was carried out at the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (Embrapa)-Amazonia Ocidental, 29 km North of Manaus, Brazil (3d 8m S, 59d 52m W, 40 - 50 m above sea level), in 1998 and 1999.Microaggregated tropical soils have shown high water conductivity even under unsaturated conditions in laboratory experiments. It is not clear, however, what depth the infiltrating soil water reaches during storm events under humid tropical conditions. Dynamics and fluxes of water were determined with high temporal resolution to a depth of 5 m in a Xanthic Hapludox of central Amazonia, Brazil. The soil water percolated to a depth of 0.9 m within 2 h of a rainfall event of 48 mm. Water fluxes were significantly slower below 0.9 m (17% of infiltration at 0 - 0.9 m) due to higher bulk densities. Percolation not only started rapidly after a rainfall event when soil water suction reached a certain threshold (ca. 20 - 30 hPa) but was also reduced to background levels less than 1 h after the rain had ended. The demonstrated extremely short-term dynamics of water fluxes have implications for measurement design of water availability and solute leaching in microaggregated tropical soil that require correct time integrals of solution concentrations and soil water dynamics. Measurement intervals of 30 min or less were necessary in our study. Rapid water flows may explain the observed high nutrient losses from the topsoil of microaggregated tropical soil and the large accumulation of nutrients in the deep soil (&gt; 5 m).",

The Fazenda Vitoria ranch is located in eastern Para near the city of Paragominas and is a mosaic of primary forest, logged forest, secondary forest, and pasture with moderately dissected topography. The Fazenda Nova Vida ranch is located in the state of Rondonia in western Amazonia and is a mosaic of primary forest, logged forest, and pastures. For Fazenda Vitoria, two dry-season Landsat images were obtained, subset, and analyzed. For Nova Vida three dry-season images and one end-of-wet-season image were obtained, subset, and analyzed. Spectral mixture analysis, which decomposes individual satellite pixels into constituent cover fractions of surface materials, was used with a general probabilistic modeling approach to derive subpixel cover fractions of PV, NPV, and S.

The NLDC scenes have been screened for cloud cover and band quality resulting in a high  grade,high quality data compilation. The GCLDC collection contains Landsat TM scenes that were purchased  by NASA from Space Imaging, formerly the Earth Observation Satellite  Company,under a special agreement to promote the use of shared data in  global change research.  The HTFP, the largest component of NASA's Landsat Pathfinder Program, contains Landsat MSS and TM scenes collected  over the past 20 years.  The goal of the HTFP is to globally map  deforestation in the humid tropical forests.  The CEES collection is the result of an effort to coordinate data needs among several Federal agencies (e.g.,Environmental Protection Agency, Department of the Interior agencies, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Defense).  These Landsat TM scenes were collected for a variety of research projects.  Ongoing NASA purchases of Landsat TM data support NASA scientists and their affiliated researchers in programs and projects including the NASA Research and Analysis Program; the Global Land Cover Test Sites Project; the HTFP, the  International Biosphere-Geosphere Programme, the NASA Applications Program; and the Landsat-7 Science Team.\n",

Data from the the Composition and Photo-Dissociative Flux Measurement (CPFM) is featured in this collection. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nThe POLARIS mission was a joint effort of NASA and NOAA that occurred in 1997 and was designed to expand on the photochemical and transport processes that cause the summer polar decreases in the stratospheric ozone. The POLARIS campaign had the overarching goal of better understanding the change of stratospheric ozone levels from very high concentrations in the spring to very low concentrations in the autumn. The NASA ER-2 high-altitude aircraft was the primary platform deployed along with balloons, satellites, and ground-sites. The POLARIS campaign was based in Fairbanks, Alaska with some flights being conducted from California and Hawaii. Flights were conducted between the summer solstice and fall equinox at mid- to high latitudes. The data collected included meteorological variables; long-lived tracers in reference to summertime transport questions; select species with reactive nitrogen (NOy), halogen (Cly), and hydrogen (HOx) reservoirs; and aerosols. More specifically, the ER-2 utilized various techniques/instruments including Laser Absorption, Gas Chromatography, Non-dispersive IR, UV Photometry, Catalysis, and IR Absorption. These techniques/instruments were used to collect data including N2O, CH4, CH3CCl3, CO2, O3, H2O, and NOy. Ground stations were responsible for collecting SO2 and O3, while balloons recorded pressure, temperature, wind speed, and wind directions. Satellites partnered with these platforms collected meteorological data and Lidar imagery. The observations were used to constrain stratospheric computer models to evaluate ozone changes due to chemistry and transport.",

    "description": "MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) views the sunlit Earth simultaneously at nine widely spaced and collects global images with high spatial detail in four colors at every angle. These images are carefully calibrated to provide accurate measures of the brightness, contrast, and color of reflected sunlight. The change in reflection at different view angles affords the means to distinguish different types of atmospheric particles (aerosols), cloud forms, and land surface covers. Combined with stereoscopic techniques, this enables construction of 3-dimensional models and more accurate estimates of the total amount of sunlight reflected by Earth's diverse environments.MISR was built for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It is part of NASA's Terra spacecraft, launched into a polar orbit around the Earth on December 18, 1999.The Southern African Fire Atmosphere Research Initiative (SAFARI) 2000 field campaign focused on the smoke and gases released into the environment of southern Africa by industrial, biological, and man-made sources such as biomass burning. The area of study and MISR path numbers include Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

The ALI is one of three instruments aboard NASA's first New Millennium Program Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) satellite. ALI is a technology validation testbed that employs novel wide-angle optics and a highly integrated multispectral and panchromatic spectroradiometer.The tandem pair was produced to evaluate the differences between ALI and ETM+ and determine if technology similar to that of the ALI is suitable for future land imaging that will continue the observations begun by the Landsat satellites in 1972.The ALI and ETM+ images are false color composites combining shortwave infrared, near infrared, and visible wavelengths, displayed as red, green, and blue, respectively. Dense vegetation appears green. The similarity of the images demonstrates the ability of the ALI to produce data comparable to ETM+. Several SAFARI 2000 field campaigns conducted in KNP provided ground-based data needed to evaluate measurements from the satellite sensors.Each band is stored as an individual binary file. A metadata file accompanies each set of ALI and ETM+ band files to document the path and row number, sample and line counts, band file names, and sun azimuth and elevation angles.

    "description": "Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key indicator of land surface states, and can provide information on surface-atmosphere heat and mass fluxes, vegetation water stress, and soil moisture. A daily, day and night, LST data set for continental Africa, including Madagascar, was derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC; 4 km resolution) data for the 6-year lifetime of the NOAA-14 satellite (from 1995 to 2000) using a modified version of the Global Inventory Mapping and Monitoring System (GIMMS) (Tucker et al., 1994). The data were projected into Albers Equal Area and aggregated to 8 km spatial resolution. The data were cloud-filtered with CLAVR-1 algorithm (Stowe et al., 1999). The LST values were estimated with a split-window technique (Ulivieri et al., 1994) that takes advantage of differential absorption of the thermal infrared signal in bands 4 and 5. The emissivity of the surface was generated using a land cover classification map (Hansen et al., 2000) combined with the FAO soil map of Africa (FAO-UNESCO, 1977) and additional maps of tree, herbaceous, and bare soil percent cover (DeFries et al., 2000). Collateral products include cloud mask, time-of-scan, latitude and longitude, and land/water mask files.The data are in flat binary files. Each data file contains 1152 columns and 1152 rows, in signed integer format (2 bytes), with 8 km by 8 km spatial resolution. A unique map exists for each day and each night of the 6-year NOAA-14 lifetime. The data are best used to infer broad temporal and spatial trends rather than pixel-by-pixel values. ",

    "description": "This dataset contains Level 2A (L2A) unrectified surface reflectance images from NASA's Airborne Visible / Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) instrument. This imagery was collected as part of the Surface Biology and Geology High-Frequency Time Series (SHIFT) campaign which occurred during February to May, 2022, with a follow up activity for one week in September. The SHIFT campaign leveraged NASA's AVIRIS-NG facility instrument to collect approximately weekly VSWIR imagery across the study area enabling traceability analyses related to the science value of VSWIR revisit without relying on multispectral proxies.  This campaign will generate precise, high-frequency data on plant communities collected over nearly 1,656 square kilometers across Santa Barbara County, California, US, and nearby coastal Pacific waters. AVIRIS-NG is a pushbroom spectral mapping system with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), designed and toleranced for high performance spectroscopy. AVIRIS-NG measures reflected radiance at 5-nm intervals in the Visible to Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) spectral range from 380-2510 nm. The AVIRIS-NG sensor has a 1 milliradian instantaneous field of view, providing altitude dependent ground sampling distances from 20 m to sub-meter range.  The AVIRIS-NG L2A data are provided in ENVI binary format, which includes a flat binary file accompanied by a header (.hdr) file holding metadata in text format.",

An imaging radar system launched aboard the NASA Space Shuttle twice in 1994, SIR-C/X-SAR's unique contributions to Earth observation and monitoring are its capability to measure, from space, the radar signature of the surface at three different wavelengths and to make measurements for different polarizations at two of those wavelengths.  The SIR-C image data help scientists understand the physics behind some of the phenomena seen in radar images at just one wavelength/polarization, such as those produced by SeaSAT.  Investigators on the SIR-C/X-SAR Science team use the radar image data to make measurements of vegetation type, extent and deforestation, soil moisture content, ocean dynamics, wave and surface wind speeds and directions, volcanism and tectonic activity, and soil erosion and desertification. The SIR-C provides multi-frequency,  multi-polarization radar data.The SIR-C instrument is composed of several subsystems:  an antenna array, a transmitter, receivers, a data-handling subsystem, and a ground SAR processor.  The data are processed into images with selectable resolution from 10 to 200 meters.  The width of the area mapped by the radar varies from 15 to 90 kilometers, depending on how   the radar is operated and on the direction in which the antenna beams are pointing.  Data from SIR-C/X-SAR are used to develop automatic techniques for extracting information from radar image data.\n",

Data was collected by the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory radiative transfer model and the Scanning Actinic Flux Spectroradiometer (SAFS). Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nThe SOLVE campaign was a NASA multi-program effort of the Upper Atmosphere Research Program (UARP), Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project (AEAP), Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling and Analysis Program (ACMAP) and Earth Observing System (EOS) of NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise (ESE). SOLVE’s primary objective was for calibrating and validating the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III satellite measurements, while examining the processes that controlled ozone levels at a mid- to high-latitude range. The major goal of SAGE III was to quantitatively assess ozone loss at high latitudes. SOLVE was a two-phase experiment, the first phase, SOLVE, occurred during the fall of 1999 through the spring of 2000. The second phase, SOLVE II, occurred during the winter of 2003.\r\n\r\nSOLVE took place in the Arctic high-latitude region during the winter. The polar ozone depletion processes cause by human-produced chlorine and bromine are most active in mid-to-late winter and early spring in the high Arctic. In order to conduct this validation experiment, NASA deployed the NASA ER-2 aircraft and NASA DC-8 aircraft. The ER-2 measured a variety of atmospheric data, including ozone (O3), H2O, CO2, ClONO2, HCl, ClO/BrO, and Cl2O2. The DC-8 aircraft measured ozone, ClO/BrO, and aerosol, among other atmospheric data. SOLVE also utilized balloon platforms, ground-based instruments, and collaborations with the German Aerospace Center’s (DLR) FALCON aircraft equipped with the OLEX Lidar to achieve the mission objectives. Overall, the campaign had 28 flights, with SOLVE featuring 17 total flights among the different aircrafts and SOLVE II featuring 11 flights.",

    "description": "The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was flown aboard the space shuttle Endeavour February 11-22, 2000. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) participated in an international project to acquire radar data which were used to create the first near-global set of land elevations.\n\nThe radars used during the SRTM mission were actually developed and flown on two Endeavour missions in 1994. The C-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar and the X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) hardware were used on board the space shuttle in April and October 1994 to gather data about Earth's environment. The technology was modified for the SRTM mission to collect interferometric radar, which compared two radar images or signals taken at slightly different angles. This mission used single-pass interferometry, which acquired two signals at the same time by using two different radar antennas. An antenna located on board the space shuttle collected one data set and the other data set was collected by an antenna located at the end of a 60-meter mast that extended from the shuttle. Differences between the two signals allowed for the calculation of surface elevation.\n\nEndeavour orbited Earth 16 times each day during the 11-day mission, completing 176 orbits. SRTM successfully collected radar data over 80% of the Earth's land surface between 60° north and 56° south latitude with data points posted every 1 arc-second (approximately 30 meters).\n  \n\nTwo resolutions of finished grade SRTM data are available through EarthExplorer from the collection held in the USGS EROS archive:\n\n1 arc-second (approximately 30-meter) high resolution elevation data offer worldwide coverage of void filled data at a resolution of 1 arc-second (30 meters) and provide open distribution of this high-resolution global data set. Some tiles may still contain voids. The SRTM 1 Arc-Second Global (30 meters) data set will be released in phases starting September 24, 2014. Users should check the coverage map in EarthExplorer to verify if their area of interest is available.\n\n3 arc-second (approximately 90-meter) medium resolution elevation data are available for global coverage. The 3 arc-second data were resampled using cubic convolution interpolation for regions between 60° north and 56° south latitude.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",

For this product, the geolocation, quality, and other data (e.g., surface characteristics for nadir observations) were also provided. L2 modeled spectra were evaluated using radiative transfer modeling algorithms. The process, referred to as retrieval, compared observed spectra to the modeled spectra and iteratively updates the atmospheric parameters. L2 standard product files include information for one molecular species (or temperature) for an entire global survey or special observation run. \r\rA global survey consisted of a maximum of 16 consecutive orbits. A Nadir sequence within the TES Global Survey was a fixed number of observations within an orbit for a Global Survey. Prior to April 24, 2005, it consisted of two low resolution scans over the same ground locations. After April 24, 2005, Global Survey data consisted of three low resolution scans. The Nadir standard product consisted of four files, where each file was composed of the Global Survey Nadir observations from one of four focal planes for a single orbit, i.e. 72 orbit sequences. The Global Survey Nadir observations only used a single set of filter mix. A Global Survey consisted of observations along 16 consecutive orbits at the start of a two day cycle, over which 3,200 retrievals were performed. Each observation was the input for retrievals of species Volume Mixing Ratios (VMR), temperature profiles, surface temperature and other data parameters with associated pressure levels, precision, total error, vertical resolution, total column density and other diagnostic quantities. \r\rEach TES Level 2 standard product reported information in a swath format conforming to the HDF-EOS Aura File Format Guidelines. Each Swath object was bounded by the number of observations in a global survey and a predefined set of pressure levels, representing slices through the atmosphere. Each standard product could have had a variable number of observations depending upon the Global Survey configuration and whether averaging is employed. Also, missing or bad retrievals were not reported. The organization of data within the Swath object was based on a superset of the UARS pressure levels used to report concentrations of trace atmospheric gases. The reporting grid was the same pressure grid used for modeling. There were 67 reporting levels from 1211.53 hPa, which allowed for very high surface pressure conditions, to 0.1 hPa, about 65 km. In addition, the products reported values directly at the surface when possible or at the observed cloud top level. Thus, in the Standard Product files each observation could have contained estimates for the concentration of a particular molecule at 67 different pressure levels within the atmosphere. However, for most retrieved profiles, the highest pressure levels were not observed due to a surface at lower pressure or cloud obscuration. For pressure levels corresponding to altitudes below the cloud top or surface, where measurements were not possible, a fill value was applied. \r\rTo minimize the duplication of information between the individual species standard products, data fields common to each species (such as spacecraft coordinates, emissivity, and other data fields) have been collected into a separate standard product, termed the TES L2 Ancillary Data product (ESDT short name: TL2ANC).",

At all plots, spectral reflectance was measured using a portable spectrometer configured with a straight fiber optic foreoptic, surface temperatures were measured using a handheld Everest Infrared Thermometer, and thaw depth (or active layer depth) was measured using a metal rod graduated in centimeter intervals. At small plots (~15 cm) at Utqiagvik (referred to as Patch plots) chambers were constructed that enclosed an individual patch to determine photosynthetic rate and estimate respiration rate (made by covering the chamber in a dark cloth). Efficiency using PAM fluorometer, ambient yield estimations, and rapid light curve measurements were taken. Chlorophyll concentration was measured with a portable spectrometer configured as a spectrophotometer. At larger plots (approximately 1 m2) which were part of the International Tundra EXperiment (ITEX plots) at Utqiagvik (referred to as Barrow) and Atqasuk, a sub-sample of five control and five warmed plots at each site were fitted with 0.45 m diameter polyvinyl chloride collars for chamber flux measurements. To determine the total fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), a series of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurements were made using a custom-made light bar consisting of a linear array of GaAsP sensors mounted within an aluminum U-bar under a white plastic diffuser. In addition, a visual estimate was made of the fraction of standing dead vegetation based on percent cover. The data are provided in comma-separated values (*.csv) format.

The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the fate of sunlight in Earth environment, as well as distinguish different types of clouds, particles and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation canopy structure.

    "title": "USGS Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles",
    "description": "A Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ) is a computer-generated image of an aerial photograph in which the image displacement caused by terrain relief and camera tilt has been removed. The DOQ combines the image characteristics of the original photograph with the georeferenced qualities of a map.\n\nDOQs are black and white (B/W), natural color, or color-infrared (CIR) images with 1-meter ground resolution.\n\nThe USGS produces three types of DOQs:\n\n1. 3.75-minute (quarter-quad) DOQs cover an area measuring 3.75-minutes longitude by 3.75-minutes latitude. Most of the U.S. is currently available, and the remaining locations should be complete by 2004. Quarter-quad DOQs are available in both Native and GeoTIFF formats. Native format consists of an ASCII keyword header followed by a series of 8-bit binary image lines for B/W and 24-bit band-interleaved-by-pixel (BIP) for color. DOQs in native format are cast to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and referenced to either the North American Datum (NAD) of 1927 (NAD27) or the NAD of 1983 (NAD83). GeoTIFF format consists of a georeferenced Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), with all geographic referencing information embedded within the .tif file. DOQs in GeoTIFF format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to NAD83. The average file size of a B/W quarter quad is 40-45 megabytes, and a color file is generally 140-150 megabytes. Quarter-quad DOQs are distributed via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) as uncompressed files.\n\n2. 7.5-minute (full-quad) DOQs cover an area measuring 7.5-minutes longitude by 7.5-minutes latitude. Full-quad DOQs are mostly available for Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Limited coverage may also be available for other states. Full-quad DOQs are available in both Native and GeoTIFF formats. Native is formatted with an ASCII keyword header followed by a series of 8-bit binary image lines for B/W. DOQs in native format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to either NAD27 or NAD83. GeoTIFF is a georeferenced Tagged Image File Format with referencing information embedded within the .tif file. DOQs in GeoTIFF format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to NAD83. The average file size of a B/W full quad is 140-150 megabytes. Full-quad DOQs are distributed via FTP as uncompressed files.\n\n3. Seamless DOQs are available for free download from the Seamless site. DOQs on this site are the most current version and are available for the conterminous U.S.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",

    "description": "The Earth-Observing One (EO-1) satellite was decommissioned March 2017. The EO-1 satellite was launched on November 21, 2000 with the NASA's New Millennium Program (NMP). The NMP was an advanced-technology development program created a new generation of technologies and mission concepts into future Earth and space science missions. Information of the EO-1 mission can be found on the EOPortal.&nbsp;All EO-1 ALI and Hyperion historical data will continue to be available through&nbsp;EarthExplorer&nbsp;for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;\r\nEO-1 Product Description\r\n\r\nThe Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite was launched November 21, 2000 as a one-year technology demonstration/validation mission. After the initial technology mission was completed, NASA and the USGS agreed to the continuation of the EO-1 program as an Extended Mission. The EO-1 Extended Mission is chartered to collect and distribute Hyperion hyperspectral and Advanced Land Imager (ALI) multispectral products according to customer tasking requests.\r\nHyperion Instrument on board the EO-1 spacecraft\r\n\r\nHyperion&nbsp;collects 220 unique spectral channels ranging from 0.357 to 2.576 micrometers with a 10-nm bandwidth. The instrument operates in a pushbroom fashion, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for all bands. The standard scene width is 7.7 kilometers. Standard scene length is 42 kilometers, with an optional increased scene length of 185 kilometers (additional information).\r\n\r\nAll Hyperion and Advanced Land Imager (ALI) data in the archive will be attempted to be processed to the Level 1Gst level of correction. If the scene fails the Level 1Gst processing level, it will be removed from the archive and will become unavailable. As of June 15th, 2009, not all of the EO-1 data has been processed; please continue to check back if the scene of your interest is not available. We will be making attempts to process the failed scene as time and workload permits; however there are no guarantees that all of the EO-1 scenes will be able to be processed.",

    "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Geospatial Program (NGP) developed the Alaska Mapping Initiative (AMI) to collaborate with the State and other Federal partners to acquire 3-dimensional elevation data to improve statewide topographic maps for Alaska. AMI coordinates Federal activities through the Alaska Mapping Executive Committee (AMEC) and State efforts through Alaska's Statewide Digital Mapping Initiative (SDMI) to ensure a unified approach for consistent data acquisition and enhancement of elevation data products.  AMI attained interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) to generate digital elevation model (DEM) data. This radar mapping technology is an effective tool for collecting data in challenging circumstances such as cloud cover, extreme weather conditions, rugged terrain, and remote locations. Airborne IFSAR data were flown over South Central Alaska in the summer of 2010 and over Northwest Alaska in 2012.",

As the instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth's surface below is successively imaged by all 9 cameras, in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the fate of sunlight in Earth environment, as well as distinguish different types of clouds, particles and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation canopy structure. MISR Level 2 Land Surface Product subset for the VBBE region V002 contains information on land directional reflectance properties; albedos (spectral and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) integrated); fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR); asssociated radiation parameters; and terrain-referenced geometric parameters.",

    "description": "The VIIRS/NPP Albedo Daily L3 Global 1 km SIN Grid NRT (VNP43MA3N) product provides albedo values at 1 km resolution for the bihemispherical reflectance white-sky albedos (WSA) and directional hemispherical reflectance black-sky albedos (BSA) at local solar noon. The VNP43MA3N product is produced daily using 16-day VIIRS data (i.e., the current day and the previous 15 days). \n\nThe VNP43 algorithm uses the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model, with the three kernel weights from VNP43MA1N to reconstruct surface anisotropic effects, correcting the directional reflectance to a common view geometry (VNP43MA4N), while also computing integrated black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon and white-sky albedo (WSA) (VNP43MA3N). Researchers can use the BRDF model parameters with a simple polynomial, to obtain black-sky albedo at any solar illumination angle. Likewise, both the BSA and WSA Science Dataset (SDS) layers can be used with a simple polynomial, to manually estimate instantaneous actual albedo (blue-sky albedo). Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) at https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/public/product_documentation/vnp43_v1_atbd.pdf\n\nThe VNP43MA3N product provides a total of 36 SDS layers including: BSA, WSA, and mandatory quality layers for nine VIIRS moderate bands: M1-M5, M7-M8, and M10-M11, as well as three broadbands: near-infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR), and visible (VIS).",

The subset was created for the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., 10 N to 25 S, 30 to 85 W). The point data are available in three formats: a comma-delimited ASCII file (*.csv), an ESRI shapefile, and an ESRI export file (*.e00).The data for the global data set (Zinke et al. 1986) were obtained from soil surveys conducted by Zinke in 1965-1984 and from soil survey literature. The main samples for laboratory analyses were collected at uniform soil increments and included bulk density determinations. Many samples reported in the literature did not have uniform soil increments or bulk density determinations. Only soil profiles that had been sampled either to a meter in depth or to actual depth were included in this database from soil survey literature. When carbon content was known but bulk densities were absent from soil samples reported in the literature, densities were estimated by regression analysis on the basis of the relationship between organic carbon content and measured bulk density in 1800 soil profiles for which bulk densities were known.Further information can be found at ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/carbon_dynamics/Zinke_soil/comp/zinke_readme.pdf.LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system.

A fundamental use of ASAS data is to characterize and understand the directional variability in solar energy scattered by various land surface cover types (e.g.,crops, forests, prairie grass, snow, or bare soil). The sensor's Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function determines the variation in the reflectance of a surface as a function of both the view zenith angle and solar illumination angle.\n\nThe ASAS sensor is a hyperspectral, multiangle, airborne remote sensing instrument maintained and operated by the Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The ASAS instrument is mounted on the underside of either NASA C-130 or NASA P-3 aircraft and is capable of off-nadir pointing from approximately 70 degrees forward to 55 degrees aft along the direction of flight. The aircraft is flown at an altitude of 5000 - 6000 meters (approximately 16,000 - 20,000 ft.).\n\nData in the ASAS collection primarily cover areas over the continental United States, but some ASAS data are also available over areas in Canada and western Africa. The ASAS data were collected between 1988 and 1994.",

Stereo-correlation is used to produce over one million individual scene-based ASTER DEMs, to which cloud masking is applied to remove cloudy pixels.  All cloud-screened DEMS are stacked and residual bad values and outliers are removed.  Selected data are averaged to create final pixel values, and residual anomalies are corrected before partitioning the data into 1 degree (°) x 1° tiles.\n\nThe ASTER GDEM covers land surfaces between 83°N and 83°S and is comprised of 22,702 tiles.  Tiles that contain at least 0.01% land area are included.  The ASTER GDEM is distributed as Geographic Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF) files with geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude).

    "description": "Fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy exchange have been measured at 38 forest, grassland, and crop sites as part of the EUROFLUX and AmeriFlux projects. A total of 97 site-years of data were compiled, primarily between 1996 and 1998 but also for 1992-1995 and 1999-2000. Half-hour flux and meteorology measurements are included plus the gap-filled half-hour estimates and aggregations to day and night, weekly, monthly, and annual periods. The FLUXNET 2000 Synthesis Workshop was held at the Marconi Conference Center, Marshall, California, June 11-14, 2000. The Marconi Flux Data Collection was compiled to aid in exploring the interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and the overlying atmosphere through carbon, water, and energy exchanges. The workshop resulted in several studies to synthesize and interpret differences and similarities in long-term measurements of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy exchanges between vegetation and the atmosphere for a spectrum of ecosystems. A series of synthesis papers based on these data and studies was published in a special issue of the Agriculture and Forest Meteorology, Volume 113, 2002. The papers are listed in the reference section. This data product is being archived as a record of the data used the AFM special issue. Updates and revisions to the data are available at the FLUXNET web site.The eddy covariance technique is used for long-term continuous measurements of mass and energy fluxes to capture seasonal dynamics and allow for a meaningful scaling with respect to time. The equipment and methodology were standardized among sites by using common software and instrumentation. Comparisons of ecosystem fluxes among sites are usually performed on annual or monthly sums calculated on complete data records; however, the average site data coverage during a year was only 65%. Therefore, development and application of robust and consistent data gap-filling methods was required before fluxes could be calculated. One of the outcomes of the FLUXNET project was computer applications to process the data into complete, consistent, quality assured, and documented data sets (Falge et al. 2001a,b). Gap-filled flux data from four different filling methods are reported. Selected meteorological parameters were also gap filled to support flux estimating methods and are reported along with non-filled meteorological data. Note that the measured/estimated CO2 fluxes and storage fluxes were summed into net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and ONLY NEE data are reported. ",

This new product suite provides global coverage of all land areas from lat 84°N to 56°S for most products, and coverage from 84°N to 90°S for several products. Some areas, namely Greenland and Antarctica, do not have data available at the 15- and 7.5-arc-second resolutions because the input source data do not support that level of detail.

    "description": "The mission was the first of a series of NASA Applications Explorer Missions and is also known as AEM-A. Day/night coverage over a given area occurred at intervals ranging from 12 to 36 hours with a 16 day repeat cycle.\n\nThe satellite was operational from April 1978 to September 1980. The initial orbit of 620 km was lowered to 540 km in February of 1980. Coverage includes parts of the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa, and Australia. The source data was transmitted to seven ground stations and stored on binary magnetic tape. The source data on tape is no longer readable and the only remaining set of HCMM data is on black and white film. Since the data could be of historical value for global change research, the images have been scanned at 1000 dpi (25 micron) making the data accessible to the scientific community. The collection includes approximately 47,000 scenes with a Hotine Oblique Mercator projection.\n\nThe Heat Capacity Mapping Mission Radiometer operated with two channels. The first detected visible to near infrared (0.5 – 1.1 micrometers) radiation and the second detected thermal infrared (10.5 – 12.5 micrometers) radiation. HCMM nomenclature refers to the visible to near infrared channel as Vis and the thermal infrared channel as IR. The scenes are designated as Day-Vis, Day-IR or Night-IR. \n\nA HCMM scene has a width of 715 km with a resolution of 500 meters for the visible channel and 600 meters for the thermal channel.",

    "description": "This data set is a subset of a global croplands data set (Ramankutty and Foley 1999a). The subset was created for the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., 10 N to 25 S, 30 to 85 W). The data are in ASCII GRID format at 5-min resolution.Navin Ramankutty and Jonathan Foley, of the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE) at the University of Wisconsin, developed a global, spatially explicit data set of reconstructed historical croplands from 1700 to 1992. The method for historical reconstruction used a simple algorithm that linked contemporary satellite data and historical cropland inventory data. A spatially explicit croplands data set for 1992 was first derived by calibrating a satellite-derived land cover classification data set against cropland inventory data for 1992. This derived data set was then used within a simple land cover change model, along with historical cropland inventory data, to derive spatially explicit maps of historical croplands. The global data set was restricted to a representation of permanent croplands (i.e., excluding shifting cultivation), which follows the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) definition of arable lands and permanent crops. Data values represent fraction of grid cell in croplands.Data for the LBA study area are available for the years 1900, 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 1992. Although the global croplands data set contains data representing croplands since 1700, essentially no croplands were in the LBA study area until 1900. Data from previous years were excluded at the suggestion of the data originator.More information can be found at ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/land_use_land_cover_change/historical_croplands/comp/uwcrop_readme.pdf.LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil.

The data are in ASCII GRID file format.In recent years, researchers have increasingly turned to remotely sensed data to improve the accuracy of data sets that describe the geographic distribution of land cover at regional and global scales. To develop improved methodologies for global land cover classifications as well as to provide global land cover products for immediate use in global change research, LGRSS researchers have employed the NASA/NOAA Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data set with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The PAL data set has a record length of 14 years (1981-1994), providing the ability to test the stability of classification algorithms. The PAL data set includes red, infrared, and thermal bands in addition to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Inclusion of these additional bands improves discrimination between cover types. The LGRSS researchers' aim was to develop and validate global land cover data sets and to develop advanced methodologies for more realistically describing the vegetative land surface based on satellite data.The 1-km global land cover product was created from 1992-1993 local area coverage (LAC) AVHRR data. The global land cover product is available for download from the University of Maryland's Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) Web site (http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/data/landcover/index.shtml). Forty-one metrics were developed to describe global vegetation phenology, and these data were used to make the 1-km land cover map.

Active fire data for AVHRR/NOAA-12 was produced using a fixed threshold fire detection technique based on the algorithm developed by the Centro de Previsao do Tempo e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC/INPE) (Setzer and Pereira, 1991; Setzer et al., 1994; Setzer and Malingreau, 1996). Active fire data for MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua was produced using a contextual fire detection technique based on NASA-University of Maryland algorithm (Justice et al., 2003; Giglio et al.2003).Resulting fire counts were compared for major biomes of Brazil (Figure 1), the nine states of the Legal Amazon (e.g., Tocantins, Figure 2), and two important road corridors in the Amazon region (Figure 3). In evaluating the daily fire counts, there is a dependence on variations in satellite viewing geometry, overpass time, atmospheric conditions, and fire characteristics (Schroeder et al., 2005). The data provided are the coordinates of daily active vegetation fires in Brazil for 2001 through 2003 at 1km resolution for both AVHRR and MODIS sensors.

The data are in ASCII GRID format.\"Major World Ecosystem Complexes Ranked by Carbon in Live Vegetation\" is a computerized database used to generate a global vegetation map of 44 different land ecosystem complexes (mosaics of vegetation or landscapes) comprising seven broad groups. The map is derived from patterns of preagricultural vegetation, modern areal surveys, and intensive biomass data from research sites. Work on the database was begun in 1960 and completed in 1980.Ecosystem complexes are defined for each 0.5-degree grid cell, reflecting the major climatic, topographic, and land-use patterns. Numeric codes are assigned to each vegetation type. Classifications include natural as well as human managed/modified complexes such as mainly cropped, residential, commercial, and park. The complexes are ranked by estimated organic carbon in the mass of live plants given in units of kilograms of carbon per square meter. Counting the cells of each type and adding their areas give total area estimates for the ecosystem complexes. Multiplying by carbon estimates gives corresponding estimates of carbon by ecosystem complex with in the LBA study area. The results help define the role of the terrestrial biosphere in the global carbon cycle.Information about the ecosystem classifications, as well as the procedure used to create the LBA subset can be found at ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/carbon_dynamics/olson/comp/olson_readme.pdf.LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system.

The algorithm was applied to recently reprocessed 500 m daily MODIS land surface reflectance data to produce burned area data sets for all of southern Africa for 2000 forward. This archived data set contains MODIS 500 m burned area products for two dry season months (July and September 2000).Burned area products are spatially explicit data sets that describe the approximate day of burning at 500 m resolution for all of southern Africa south of the Equator, including Madagascar. The burned area maps are compressed GeoTiff files. Several text files are included in the compressed files to aid ENVI (Research Systems, Inc.) users, including ENVI header files and ENVI density slice files. The data set also includes a projection parameters file.The MODIS burned area data set was validated using a methodology based upon the interpretation of multitemporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) data as described in Roy et al. (in press).",

An exception is that no 2.1mm data for black-sky is being archived at this time. The data spatial extent is from approximately 5 degrees N to -30 degrees S latitude and 5 minutes E to 60 degrees E longitude and covers 7 sixteen day periods starting on July 11 through October 15, 2000.Map Products, containing spatially complete land surface albedo data, are generated at 1-minute resolution on an equal-angle grid. The maps are stored in separate HDF files for each wavelength, each 16-day period and each albedo type (white- and black-sky). Data belonging to black sky and white sky albedo have been zipped separately. This format allows the user to have flexibility to download and store only the data absolutely needed.The One-Minute Land Ecosystem Classification Product is a global (static map) data set of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) classification scheme stored on an equal-angle rectangular grid at 1-minute resolution. The dataset is generated from the official MODIS land ecosystem classification dataset, MOD12Q1 for year 2000, day 289 data (October 15, 2000). This dataset is used in generating the spatially complete albedo maps, but is also a stand-alone product designed for use by the user community. The Land Ecosystem Classification Map File product file is stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).",

    "description": "Soil moisture and temperature profile sensors were deployed at flux tower sites in Mongu, Zambia and Skukuza, South Africa. In addition, thermal infrared sensors were deployed to monitor surface temperature at the sites, and soil samples were collected for physical property analysis. A heat-flux plate was also installed at 10 cm depth at the Mongu site. The data cover the period variously from August, 1999 to December, 2001.At the Mongu site, three profiles of soil moisture and temperature were obtained to a maximum depth of 125 cm. These profiles were located approximately 30 meters north of the Mongu flux tower, within the Kataba Local Forest. Surface radiometric temperature was measured by thermal infrared sensors deployed on top of the 30-meter tower and on a tree.  At the Skukuza site, two profiles of soil moisture and temperature were obtained to a maximum depth of 40 cm in a Combretum stand. The radiometric temperature of the tree crown and the background surface were monitored by infrared thermocouple sensors deployed on a pole at 2.5 m and 5 m heights. Soil samples were collected at different depths in the vicinity of the soil profiles at each site and were analyzed at CSIR in Pretoria to determine bulk density, texture, and particle size distribution. The data files are stored as ASCII text files, in comma-separated-value (.csv) format. Associated with each data file is a metadata (.txt ) file.

    "description": "The National Botanical Institute (NBI) has mapped woody plant species distribution to provide estimates of individual species contribution to peak leaf area index for designated vegetation types in southern Africa (Rutherford et al., 2000). The target was to account for 80% of the woody vegetation leaf area in terms of named species, for 80% of the surface area of Africa south of the equator. The data sources include published and unpublished species lists for vegetation types and individual sample plots, with the species contribution estimated by local experts in terms of dominants and subdominants. Source maps include: Low and Rebelo (1998); Giess (1971); Wild and Barbosa (1968); Barbosa (1970); and White (1983). Each source map delineates a wide variety of land cover categories that differ from region to region. Because vegetation discontinuities exist along some of the regional borders and a perfectly continuous regional map could not be achieved within the timeframe and budget of the project, the final map is made up of six independent sub-regional maps. A cross-referenced database of woody plant species, in order of species dominance, associated with all mapped units is provided.The data set contains six GIS shapefile archives, each containing a shape file for a given region in southern Africa on a 5 x 5 degree grid. An accompanying ASCII file contains the species list associated with the map files. The regional NBI Vegetation Map (a compilation of the 6 independent sub-regional coverages) is provided as a JPEG image.",

The USGS distributes the C-band (5.8 cm) and L-band (23.5 cm) data. All X-band (3 cm) data is distributed by DLR.\n\nThere are several types of products that are derived from the SIR-C data:\n\n    Survey Data is intended as a \"quick look\" browse for viewing the areas that were imaged by the SIR-C system. The data consists of a strip image of an entire data swath. Resolution is approximately 100 meters, processed to a 50-meter pixel spacing. Files are distributed via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) download.\n     \n    Precision (Standard) Data consists of a frame image of a data segment, which represents a processed subset of the data swath. It contains high-resolution multifrequency and multipolarization data. All precision data is in CEOS format.\n\nThe following types of precision data products are available:\n\n    Single-Look Complex (SLC) consists of one single-look file for each scene, per frequency. Each data segment will cover 50 kilometers along the flight track, and is broken into four processing runs (two L band, two C-band). Resolution and polarization will depend on the mode in which the data was collected. Available as calibrated or uncalibrated data.\n     \n    Multi-Look Complex (MLC) is based on an averaging of multiple looks, and consists of one file for each scene per frequency. Each data segment will cover 100 km along the flight track, and is broken into two processing runs (one L band and one C band). Polarization will depend on the modes in which the looks were collected. The data is available in 12.5- or 25-meter pixel spacing.\n     \n    Reformatted Signal Data (RSD) consists of the raw radar signal data only. Each data segment will cover 100 km along the flight track, and the segment will be broken into two processing runs (L-band and C-band).\n     \n    Interferometry Data consists of experimental multitemporal data that covers the same area. Most data takes were collected during repeat passes within the second flight (days 7, 8, 9, and/or 10). In addition, nine data takes were collected during the second flight that were repeat passes of the first flight. Most data takes were also single polarization, although dual and quad polarization data was also collected on some passes. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is not included with any of the SIR-C interferometric data.\n\nThe following types of interferometry products are available:\n\n    Interferometric Single-Look Complex (iSLC) consists of two or more uncalibrated SLC images that have been processed with the same Doppler centroid to allow interferometric processing. Each frame image covers 50 kilometers along the flight track. The data is available in CEOS format.\n     \n    Raw Interferogram product (RIn) involves the combination of two data takes over the same area to produce an interferogram for each frequency (L-band and C-band). The data is available in TAR format.\n     \n    Reformatted Signal Data (RSD) consists of radar signal data that has been processed from two or more data takes over the same area, but the data has not been combined. Although this is not technically an interferometric product, the RSD can then be used to generate an interferogram. Each frame will cover 100 km along the flight track. The data is available in CEOS format.",

In accordance with the DTED® 2 specification, the terrain elevation data have been edited to portray water bodies that meet minimum capture criteria. Ocean, lake and river shorelines were identified and delineated. Lake elevations were set to a constant value. Ocean elevations were set to zero. Rivers were stepped down monotonically to maintain proper flow. After this processing was done, the shorelines from the one arc second (approx. 30-meter) DTED® 2 were saved as vectors in ESRI 3-D Shapefile format.\n\nIn most cases, two orthorectified image mosaics (one for ascending passes and one for descending passes) at a one arc second resolution were available for identifying water bodies and delineating shorelines in each 1 x1 cell. These were used as the primary source for water body editing. The guiding principle for this editing was that water must be depicted as it was in February 2000 at the time of the shuttle flight. A Landcover water layer and medium-scale maps and charts were used as supplemental data sources, generally as supporting evidence for water identified in the image mosaics. Since the Landcover water layer was derived mostly from Landsat 5 data collected a decade earlier than the Shuttle mission and the map sources had similar currency problems, there were significant seasonal and temporal differences between the depiction of water in the ancillary sources and the actual extent of water bodies in February 2000 in many instances. In rare cases, where the SRTM image mosaics were missing or unusable, Landcover was used to delineate the water in the SRTM cells. The DTED® header records for those cells are documented accordingly.\n\n",

The subset was created for the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., 10 N to 25 S, 30 to 85 W). The data are in ASCII GRID format.The original global data set (Wilson and Henderson-Sellers 1985a) is an archive of soil type and land cover data derived for use in general circulation models (GCMs). The data were collated from maps depicting natural vegetation, forestry, agriculture, land use, and soil, and they were archived at a resolution of 1 latitude by 1 longitude. The data set indicates soil type, soil data reliability, primary vegetation, secondary vegetation, and land cover data reliability. Approximately 50 land cover classifications are used, including categories for agricultural and urban uses. The inclusion of secondary vegetation type is particularly useful in areas with cover types that may have a fragmented distribution, such as in areas of urban development. The soil type data are classified according to climatically important properties for GCMs, and they indicate color (light, medium, or dark), texture, and drainage quality of the soil. The land cover data are compatible with the soils data, forming a coherent and consistent data set. The reliability of the land cover data is ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 (high to low). The reliability of the soil data is ranked as high, good, moderate, fair, or poor.Recommendations for the use of these data, as well as more detailed information can be found in Wilson and Henderson-Sellers (1985b).Further data set information can be found at ftp://daac.ornl.gov/data/lba/land_use_land_cover_change/wilhend/comp/wilhend_readme.pdf.LBA was a cooperative international research initiative led by Brazil. NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system.
