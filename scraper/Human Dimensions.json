The MCD64A1 burned-area mapping approach employs 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Surface Reflectance imagery coupled with 1 kilometer (km) MODIS active fire observations. The algorithm uses a burn sensitive Vegetation Index (VI) to create dynamic thresholds that are applied to the composite data. The VI is derived from MODIS shortwave infrared atmospherically corrected surface reflectance bands 5 and 7 with a measure of temporal texture. The algorithm identifies the date of burn for the 500 m grid cells within each individual MODIS tile. The date is encoded in a single data layer as the ordinal day of the calendar year on which the burn occurred with values assigned to unburned land pixels and additional special values reserved for missing data and water grid cells. \r\n\r\nThe data layers provided in the MCD64A1 product include Burn Date, Burn Data Uncertainty, Quality Assurance, along with First Day and Last Day of reliable change detection of the year. \r\n\r\nValidation at stage 3 ( https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Burned Area product.

    "description": "Version 3 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 3.\nThe goal of this data set is to create and archive a Level 2 SO2 Earth Science Data Record (ESDR)  from backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) measurements from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) flown on NASA's Nimbus - 7 satellite in 1978-1993. We apply TOMS ozone team  calibration techniques and consistent MEaSUREs SO2 (MS_SO2) algorithm, to obtain the best measurement-based ESDR of volcanic and anthropogenic SO2 masses and emissions. \n\nAs part of the NASA's Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program, the Goddard Earth Science (GES) Data and Information Data Center (DISC) has released a new SO2 Earth System Data Record (ESDR), TOMSN7SO2, re-processed using new 4 UV wavelength bands MS_SO2 algorithm that spans the full Nimbus 7 data period. TOMSN7SO2 is a Level 2 orbital swath product, which will be used to study the fifteen-year SO2 record from the Nimbus-7 TOMS and to expand the historical database of known volcanic eruptions.\n\n Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is a short-lived gas primarily produced by volcanoes, power plants, refineries, metal smelting and burning of fossil fuels. Where SO2 remains near the Earth s surface, it is toxic, causes acid rain, and degrades air quality. Where SO2 is lofted into the free troposphere, it forms aerosols that can alter cloud reflectivity and precipitation. In the stratosphere, volcanic SO2 forms sulfate aerosols that can result in climate change.\n",

    "description": "The OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 product is part of the MEaSUREs (Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments) suite of products.\n\nIt is retrieved from the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) Nadir Mapper (NM) spectrometer and provides contiguous daily global monitoring of anthropogenic and volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2), an important pollutant and aerosol precursor that affects both air quality and the climate. The product is based on the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center principal component analysis (PCA) spectral fitting algorithm (Li et al., 2013, 2017), and continues (Zhang et al., 2017) NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) standard Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument SO2 product (OMSO2). \n\nThe latest OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V2 product uses new Jacobian lookup tables and more realistic model based a priori profiles in anthropogenic SO2 retrievals. This helps to more accurately account for the pixel-to-pixel variation in SO2 sensitivity due to different factors such as the vertical distribution of SO2, solar and viewing angles, surface reflectivity, and cloudiness. As compared with the previous OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V1.2 product that assumes the same SO2 sensitivity for all OMPS pixels, the new V2 anthropogenic SO2 retrievals have reduced retrieval biases especially over background regions (see Figure 1 for an example). The same updated PCA SO2 retrieval algorithm (Li et al., 2020) is also used to produce the recently released OMSO2 V2 product (doi:10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2022).

A single time-independent site-specific Air-Mass Factor (AMF) value for each site was calculated (McLinden et al., 2014) and applied consistently to each satellite SCD dataset to derive SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs=SCDs/AMFs). The emission estimate method is based on a fit of satellite VCDs to an empirical plume model developed to describe the SO2 spatial distribution near emission point sources. The plume model assumes that the SO2 concentrations emitted from a point source decline exponentially with distance and that they are affected by turbulent diffusion that can be described by a two-dimensional (2D) exponentially modified Gaussian function. The total SO2 mass is derived from the fit and the annual emission rate is calculated as the ratio between the total mass and the prescribed SO2 lifetime.",

The VNP64 burned area mapping approach employs 750 m VIIRS imagery coupled with 750 m VIIRS active fire observations. The hybrid algorithm applies dynamic thresholds to composite imagery generated from a burn-sensitive Vegetation Index (VI) derived from VIIRS shortwave infrared channels M8 and M11, and a measure of temporal texture.

There are three data files with this data set for the reference years 1990 and 1995. Over 127,000 administrative units and population counts were collected and integrated from various sources to create the gridded data. In brief, GPW was created using the following steps:    * Population data were estimated for the product reference years, 1990 and 1995, either by the data source or by interpolating or extrapolating the given estimates for other years.    * Additional population estimates were created by adjusting the source population data to match UN national population estimates for the reference years.    * Borders and coastlines of the spatial data were matched to the Digital Chart of the World where appropriate and lakes from the Digital Chart of the World were added.    * The resulting data were then transformed into grids of UN-adjusted and unadjusted population counts for the reference years.    * Grids containing the area of administrative boundary data in each cell (net of lakes) were created and used with the count grids to produce population densities.As with any global data set based on multiple data sources, the spatial and attribute precision of GPW is variable. The level of detail and accuracy, both in time and space, vary among the countries for which data were obtained.",

    "description": "The Global Landslide Nowcast addresses the need for real-time situational awareness of landslide hazard. The Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness model (LHASA) combines satellite rainfall estimates from the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM) with soil moisture estimates from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and other factors to produce a map of locations where rainfall-triggered landslide activity is probable. Due to the latency of the rainfall data, the nowcast is a near-real time product with a minimum latency of 5 hours. Although the model could be run every half hour, this archive contains a daily record derived from a retrospective model run.\nThe Global Landslide Nowcast version 2.0.0 retains replaces the heuristic decision tree from version 1.0 with a machine learning model. Instead of merging all factors other than precipitation into a susceptibility map, LHASA 2.0 takes in each variable as a separate input layer. The most important change is the replacement of the categorical nowcast with a probabilistic output. This will enable users to adjust the threshold to suit their specific application and geographic location.\n",

Plot characterization data includes stand age, site drainage, disturbance history, crown combustion severity, seedbed conditions, and stand structural attributes. Gridded values of Hargreaves Climate Moisture Deficit (CMD) were obtained for each plot where plot coordinates were available. These values included 30-year normals (1981-2010) and CMD in the two years immediately following the fire year.

    "title": "ABoVE: Wildfire Date of Burning within Fire Scars across Alaska and Canada, 2001-2019",
    "description": "This dataset provides estimates of wildfire progression represented by date of burning (DoB) within fire scars across Alaska and Canada for the period 2001-2019. Burn scar locations were obtained from two datasets: the Alaskan Interagency Coordination Center (AICC) and the Natural Resources Canada (NRC) databases. All scars within these databases were used in this study. The estimated DoB was derived using an algorithm for identifying the first fire occurrence from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire detection product (MCD14ML, Collection 6) and to subsequently determine all dates of burning within fire scars. The DoB data are provided as polygons and map the daily progression of a fire within each burn scar. As a result, there is one polygon for each DoB detected within an identified burn scar boundary. The MODIS active fire points associated with the burn scar data are also provided. Data for the period 2001-2015 were first published in 2017 and data for the period 2016-2019 were added in January 2021.",

    "description": "ACCLIP_Aerosol_AircraftInSitu_WB57_Data is the in-situ aerosol data collected during the Asian Summer Monsoon Chemical &amp; Climate Impact Project (ACCLIP). Data from the Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry - Next Generation (PALMS-NG), Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), Nucleation-Mode Aerosol Size Spectrometer (N-MASS), Printed Optical Particle Spectrometer (POPS), and the Ultra-High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer (UHSAS) is featured in this collection. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nACCLIP is an international, multi-organizational suborbital campaign that aims to study aerosols and chemical transport that is associated with the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) in the Western Pacific region from 15 July 2022 to 31 August 2022. The ASM is the largest meteorological pattern in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the summer and is associated with persistent convection and large anticyclonic flow patterns in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). This leads to significant enhancements in the UTLS of trace species that originate from pollution or biomass burning. Convection connected to the ASM occurs over South, Southeast, and East Asia, a region with complex and rapidly changing emissions due to its high population density and economic growth. Pollution that reaches the UTLS from this region can have significant effects on the climate and chemistry of the atmosphere, making it important to have an accurate representation and understanding of ASM transport, chemical, and microphysical processes for chemistry-climate models to characterize these interactions and for predicting future impacts on climate.\r\n\r\nThe ACCLIP campaign is conducted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) with the primary goal of investigating the impacts of Asian gas and aerosol emissions on global chemistry and climate. The NASA WB-57 and NCAR G-V aircraft are outfitted with state-of-the-art sensors to accomplish this. ACCLIP seeks to address four scientific objectives related to its main goal. The first is to investigate the transport pathways of ASM uplifted air from inside of the anticyclone to the global UTLS. Another objective is to sample the chemical content of air processed in the ASM in order to quantify the role of the ASM in transporting chemically active species and short-lived climate forcing agents to the UTLS to determine their impact on stratospheric ozone chemistry and global climate. Third, information is obtained on aerosol size, mass, and chemical composition that is necessary for determining the radiative effects of the ASM to constrain models of aerosol formation and for contrasting the organic-rich ASM UTLS aerosol population with that of the background aerosols. Last, ACCLIP seeks to measure the water vapor distribution associated with the monsoon dynamical structure to evaluate transport across the tropopause and determine the role of the ASM in water vapor transport in the stratosphere.",

    "description": "This dataset provides information on greenhouse gases and human-produced air pollution, including atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), tropospheric ozone (O3), and black carbon (BC) aerosols, collected during airborne campaigns conducted by NASA's Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission. This dataset includes merged data from all instruments plus additional data such as numbered profiles and distance flown. Merged data have been created for seven different sampling intervals. In the case of data obtained over longer time intervals (e.g. flask data), the merge files provide (weighted) averages to match the sampling intervals. ATom deploys an extensive gas and aerosol payload on the NASA DC-8 aircraft for a systematic, global-scale sampling of the atmosphere, profiling continuously from 0.2 to 12 km altitude. Flights occurred in each of 4 seasons from 2016 to 2018. Flights originate from the Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, California, fly north to the western Arctic, south to the South Pacific, east to the Atlantic, north to Greenland, and return to California across central North America. ATom establishes a single, contiguous, global-scale dataset. This comprehensive dataset will be used to improve the representation of chemically reactive gases and short-lived climate forcers in global models of atmospheric chemistry and climate. Profiles of the reactive gases will also provide critical information for the validation of satellite data, particularly in remote areas where in situ data is lacking. Complete aircraft flight information including, but not limited to, latitude, longitude, and altitude are also provided. This data release provides results from all instruments on all four ATom flight campaigns.",

Topsoil loss at the county- and state-levels was derived from analyses of agricultural land at selected sites across the study area. From WorldView imagery, 759 fields were identified that had exposed bare soil (210 km2) and were grouped into 28 sites. Gridded estimates of the SOCI and of the probability of exposed B-horizon soil were determined for each field within the sites. Topography measures, including elevation (m), curvature (m-1), and slope (deg), were extracted over the entire study area from LiDAR-derived digital elevation models at a 4 m resolution acquired from 2003-2018. Within each of the 28 study sites, the SOCI and topographic curvature values were extracted from co-located pixels. Topsoil loss was estimated from the relationship between subsoil exposure and topography and averaged across each site.The relationship between topsoil loss and topographic curvature was used to up-scale and predict topsoil and economic losses at the county and state-levels across the entire 375,000 km2 study area. The data have been used to demonstrate a robust and scalable method for estimating the magnitude of erosion in agricultural landscapes.",

    "description": "This dataset provides related gridded outputs of future modeled forest carbon sequestration priority and related species richness and habitat suitability for the western United States. The primary dataset is of the ranking of forest lands in the western U.S. for preservation based on the ability of these lands to sequester carbon over the coming century. The preservation ranking was derived from the results of simulations of future potential forest net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and vulnerability to drought and wildfire, as modeled from 2020 to 2099 at 4 km x 4 km resolution using a modified version of the Community Land Model (CLM 4.5). In addition, data files of potential forest NEP ranking and the forest vulnerability ranking are also provided. Co-located data of species richness for amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles are included to illustrate habitat suitability in relation to forest carbon preservation rankings. There are two files for each vertebrate class, one reflecting all western U.S. species included in the USGS GAP Analysis Project and a second for the subset of species listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Establishing this forest carbon preservation priority ranking for forest lands in the western U.S. will help guide the conservation of land for climate change mitigation activities and improved harvest management in the region.",

The database fills an important gap for model calibration, model validation, and hypothesis testing at global and regional scales. The database archive includes: a Microsoft Office Access Database; data files for all tables in the database; query outputs from the database; and SQL script file for re-creating the database from the tables. The database is structured by site (i.e., a forest or stand of known geographical location, biome, species composition, and management regime). It contains carbon budget variables (fluxes and stocks), ecosystem traits (standing biomass, leaf area index, age), and ancillary information (management regime, climate, soil characteristics) for 529 sites from eight forest biomes. Data entries originated from peer-reviewed literature and personal communications with researchers involved in Fluxnet. Flux estimates were included in the database when they were based on direct measurements (e.g., tower-based eddy covariance system measurements), derived from single or multiple direct measurements, or modeled. Stand description was based on observed values, and climatic description was based on the CRU data set and ORCHIDEE model output. Uncertainty for each carbon balance component in the database was estimated in a uniformed way by expert judgment. Robustness of CO2 balances was tested, and closure terms were introduced as a numerical way to approach data quality and flux uncertainty at the biome level.",

The study areas covered two ecozones (Boreal Plains and Boreal Shield), two stand-replacing history types (fire and timber harvest), three soil moisture classes (xeric, mesic, and subhygric), and three stand dominance classifications (coniferous, deciduous, and mixed). To spatially extrapolate estimates of combustion to all 2015 fires in Saskatchewan, a predictive radial support vector machine model was trained on the 47 burned stands with associated environmental variables and geospatial predictors and applied to historical fire areas.

Measurements were completed in 2016 at 47 stands that burned in the 2015 Saskatchewan wildfires (Egg, Philion, and Brady) and at 32 unburned stands in comparable adjacent areas. Stands were characterized through field observations and sampling of the vegetative community (i.e., tree species, abundance, and biophysical measurements, stand age, coarse woody debris, history of fires or logging), soils (i.e., soil moisture class, unburned and burned soil organic layer depth, samples for bulk density and carbon analyses), and basic landscape geophysical traits. From these results, the pre-fire carbon stocks and carbon combustion values from both the above- and below-ground pools were estimated using a combination of linear and mixed-effects modeling and were calibrated against carbons stocks from the unburned stands. Estimates of uncertainty were generated for above- and below-ground carbon stocks and combustion values using a Monte Carlo framework paired with classic uncertainty propagation techniques.",

The maps were derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) imagery and two separate multiple linear regression models trained with field data; one for the Plains and a second for the Shield ecoregion. Field observations were used to estimate area burned in each of five severity classes (unburned, singed, light, moderate, severely burned) in six stratified randomly selected plots of 10 x 10-m in size across a 1-ha site. Using this five class scale a burn severity index (BSI) for each 1-ha site was calculated using multiple weighted and averaged field parameters. Pre- and post-fire phenologically paired Landsat 8 images were used to model the five discrete severity classes using midpoints as breaks.",

This product includes data from the VIIRS, GOES-16, and GOES-17 satellites. Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nCompleted during summer 2019, FIREX-AQ utilized a combination of instrumented airplanes, satellites, and ground-based instrumentation. Detailed fire plume sampling was carried out by the NASA DC-8 aircraft, which had a comprehensive instrument payload capable of measuring over 200 trace gas species, as well as aerosol microphysical, optical, and chemical properties. The DC-8 aircraft completed 23 science flights, including 15 flights from Boise, Idaho and 8 flights from Salina, Kansas. NASA’s ER-2 completed 11 flights, partially in support of the FIREX-AQ effort. The ER-2 payload was made up of 8 satellite analog instruments and provided critical fire information, including fire temperature, fire plume heights, and vegetation/soil albedo information. NOAA provided the NOAA-CHEM Twin Otter and the NOAA-MET Twin Otter aircraft to measure chemical processing in the lofted plumes of Western wildfires. The NOAA-CHEM Twin Otter focused on nighttime plume chemistry, from which data is archived at the NASA Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC). The NOAA-MET Twin Otter collected measurements of air movements at fire boundaries with the goal of understanding the local weather impacts of fires and the movement patterns of fires. NOAA-MET Twin Otter data will be archived at the ASDC in the future. Additionally, a ground-based station in McCall, Idaho and several mobile laboratories provided in-situ measurements of aerosol microphysical and optical properties, aerosol chemical compositions, and trace gas species. \r\n\r\nThe Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) campaign was a NOAA/NASA interagency intensive study of North American fires to gain an understanding on the integrated impact of the fire emissions on the tropospheric chemistry and composition and to assess the satellite’s capability for detecting fires and estimating fire emissions. The overarching goal of FIREX-AQ was to provide measurements of trace gas and aerosol emissions for wildfires and prescribed fires in great detail, relate them to fuel and fire conditions at the point of emission, characterize the conditions relating to plume rise, and follow plumes downwind to understand chemical transformation and air quality impacts.

See Table 1 for the sites and the temporal range of the available images. The scenes are in GeoTIFF format in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), WGS-84 projection, and 15-meter resolution.The SAR images are subset scenes of approximately 60 km x 70 km that include an established site in one of the monitoring networks. The spatial resolution of all scenes is 15 meters. These scenes are distributed as geotif files with appropriate projection information defined within the file.The acquisition mode for all data is the Fine Beam Double Polarization or FBD with the HH/HV polarization. The HH and HV channels are distributed as 3 channels to allow for an intuitive image display. The HH band is displayed in the red and blue channels and the HV band is displayed in the green channel. For some images only single polarization is available; these images are distributed as grayscale images.The source of the data is the PALSAR (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensor flying on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). The PALSAR data are in dual Polarization, HH+HV, mode. Bands HH (red and blue) and Band-HV (green) can be used to visualize land use patterns. The resulting images show vegetation in shades of green and barren land in shades of pink or purple.",

Gridded predictions of carbon combustion and burn depth for the same period within the ABoVE extended domain using the burn area maps and field data are also available. Fire locations and date of burn (DOB) were detected by MODIS-derived active fire products. Burned area was primarily estimated from finer-scale Landsat imagery using a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) algorithm and upscaled to an approximate 500 m MODIS resolution. Aboveground combustion, belowground combustion, and burn depth were statistically modeled at the pixel level for every mapped burned pixel in the ABoVE extended domain based on field observations across Alaska and western Canada. Predictor variables included remotely sensed indicators of fire severity, topography, soils, climate, and fire weather. Quality flags for burned area and combustion are available. Fire is the dominant disturbance agent in Alaskan and Canadian boreal ecosystems and releases large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. These data are useful for studies of disturbance, fire ecology, and carbon cycling in boreal ecosystems.",

Both images are from Landsat 5, path 231, row 62. The Manauas area experienced a squall line with intense downbursts from January 16-18, 2005, that resulted in widespread blowdown and tree mortality. The pre- and post-disturbance Landsat images were obtained and processed using spectral mixture analysis (SMA) in order to investigate forest disturbance and tree mortatility resulting from the downburst. SMA was based on scene-derived end-members of green vegetation (GV, photosynthetically active vegetation), NPV ( wood, dead vegetation, and surface litter), soil, and shade obtained using a pixel purity index (PPI) algorithm (Negron-Juarez et al., 2010). Changes in NPV due to disturbance were calculated by subtracting the 2004 NPV image from the 2005 NPV image. This NPV difference image is provided. There are three image files (.tif) with this data set: The two Landsat images that were georectified and converted to reflectance values and the NPV difference image.

Specifically, the two images resulting from SMA as applied to the Landsat images collected on the 14th of October, 2004 and the 29th of July, 2005 to determine per-pixel fractional abundance of GV, NPV (wood, dead vegetation, and surface litter), soil, and shade and the 2004 NPV and 2005 NPV images that were used to derive the NPV changes image (which we do provide) (Negron-Juarez, et al., 2010).",

    "description": "The Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Production from SRES Emissions and Socioeconomic Scenarios is an update to a major crop modeling study by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). The initial study was published in 1997, based on output of HadCM2 model forced with greenhouse gas concentration from the IS95 emission scenarios in 1997. Results of the initial study are presented at SEDAC's Potential Impacts of Climate Change on World Food Supply: Data Sets from a Major Crop Modeling Study, released in 2001. The co-authors developed and tested a method for investigating the spatial implications of climate change on crop production. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) dynamic process crop growth models, are specified and validated for one hundred and twenty seven sites in the major world agricultural regions. Results from the crop models, calibrated and validated in the major crop-growing regions, are then used to test functional forms describing the response of yield changes in the climate and environmental conditions. This updated version is based on HadCM3 model output along with GHG concentrations from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). The crop yield estimates incorporate some major improvements: 1) consistent crop simulation methodology and climate change scenarios; 2) weighting of model site results by contribution to regional and national, and rainfed and irrigated production; 3) quantitative foundation for estimation of physiological CO2 effects on crop yields; 4) Adaptation is explicitly considered; and 5) results are reported by country rather than by Basic Linked System region. The data are produced by A. Iglesias and C. Rosenzweig and the maps are produced by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).",

Multiple hazards such as weather and climate are characterized as a frequency of heat wave, cold spells, drought, and heavy precipitation events along with anomalies of temperature and precipitation using high resolution (4 km) downscaled climate projections. Exposure is characterized by projections of population, infrastructure, and built surfaces prone to multiple hazards including sea level rise and storm surges. Vulnerability is characterized by projections of demographic groups most sensitive to climate hazards. This approach can guide planners in targeting counties at most risk and where adaptation strategies to reduce exposure or protect vulnerable populations might be best applied.",

Derived from a careful review of the environmental literature, these twin goals mirror the priorities expressed by policymakers. Environmental health and ecosystem vitality are gauged using sixteen indicators tracked in six well-established policy categories: Environmental Health, Air Quality, Water Resources, Productive Natural Resources, Biodiversity and Habitat, and Sustainable Energy. The Pilot 2006 EPI utilizes a proximity-to-target methodology focused on a core set of environmental outcomes linked to policy goals for which every government should be held accountable. By identifying specific targets and measuring how close each country comes to them, the EPI provides a factual foundation for policy analysis and a context for evaluating performance. Issue-by-issue and aggregate rankings facilitate cross-country comparisons both globally and within relevant peer groups. The Pilot 2006 EPI is the result of collaboration among the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), World Economic Forum (WEF), and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), European Commission.",

    "description": "The 2008 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) centers on two broad environmental protection objectives: (1) reducing environmental stresses on human health, and (2) promoting ecosystem vitality and sound natural resource management. Derived from a careful review of the environmental literature, these twin goals mirror the priorities expressed by policymakers. Environmental health and ecosystem vitality are gauged using 25 indicators tracked in six well-established policy categories: Environmental Health (Environmental Burden of Disease, Water, and Air Pollution), Air Pollution (effects on ecosystems), Water (effects on ecosystems), Biodiversity and Habitat, Productive Natural Resources (Forestry, Fisheries, and Agriculture), and Climate Change. The 2008 EPI utilizes a proximity-to-target methodology in which performance on each indicator is rated on a 0 to 100 scale (100 represents ï¿½at targetï¿½). By identifying specific targets and measuring how close each country comes to them, the EPI provides a foundation for policy analysis and a context for evaluating performance. Issue-by-issue and aggregate rankings facilitate cross-country comparisons both globally and within relevant peer groups. The 2008 EPI is the result of collaboration among the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), World Economic Forum (WEF), and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), European Commission.",

All country road networks have been joined topologically at the borders, and many countries have been edited for internal topology. Source data for each country are provided in the documentation, and users are encouraged to refer to the readme file for use constraints that apply to a small number of countries. Because the data are compiled from multiple sources, the date range for road network representations ranges from the 1980s to 2010 depending on the country (most countries have no confirmed date), and spatial accuracy varies. The baseline global data set was compiled by the Information Technology Outreach Services (ITOS) of the University of Georgia. Updated data for 27 countries and 6 smaller geographic entities were assembled by Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), with a focus largely on developing countries with the poorest data coverage.",

    "description": "The INFORM Global Risk Index 2019 Mid Year, v0.3.7 data set identifies the countries at a high risk of humanitarian crisis that are more likely to require international assistance. The INFORM Global Risk Index (GRI) model is based on risk concepts published in the scientific literature and envisages three dimensions of risk: Hazard &amp; Exposure, Vulnerability, and Lack of Coping Capacity. The INFORM GRI model is split into different levels to provide a quick overview of the underlying factors leading to humanitarian risk. The INFORM GRI model supports a proactive crisis management framework, and will be helpful for an objective allocation of resources for disaster management, as well as for coordinated actions focused on anticipating, mitigating, and preparing for humanitarian emergencies. Only the two main sections, Vulnerability and Lack of Coping Capacity, not the Hazard &amp; Exposure section, were used in the IPCC AR6.",

These data were taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report and Rosenzweig et al. (2008). It consists of responses in the the physical, terrestrial biological systems and marine-ecosystems. The observations that were selected include data that demonstrate a statistically significant trend in change in either direction in systems related to temperature or other climate change variable, and the is for at least 20 years between 1970 and 2004, although study periods may extend earlier or later. For each observation, the data series is described in terms of system, region, longitude and latitude, dates and duration, statistical significance, type of impact, and whether or not land use was identified as a driving factor. System changes are taken from ~80 studies (of which ~75 are new since the IPCC Third Assessment Report) containing more than 29,500 data series. Observations in the database are characterized as a \"change consistent with warming\" or a \"change not consistent with warming\", based on information from the underlying studies.",

The LECZs were derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), 3 arc-second (~90m) data which were post processed by ISciences LLC to include only elevations less than 20m contiguous to coastlines; and to supplement SRTM data in northern and southern latitudes. The population and land area statistics presented herein are summarized at the low coastal elevations of less than or equal to 1m, 3m, 5m, 7m, 9m, 10m, 12m, and 20m. Additionally, estimates are provided for elevations greater than  20m, and nationally. The spatial coverage of this data set includes 202 of the 232 countries and statistical areas delineated in the Gridded Rural-Urban Mapping Project version 1 (GRUMPv1) data set. The 30 omitted areas were not included because they were landlocked, or otherwise lacked coastal features. This data set makes use of the population inputs of GRUMPv1 allocated at 3 arc-seconds to match the SRTM elevations, and at 30 arc-seconds resolution in order to reflect uncertainty levels in the product resulting from the interplay of input population data resolutions (based on census Units) and the elevation data. Urban and rural areas are differentiated by the GRUMPv1 Urban Extents. This data set is produced by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).",

This data set updates initial estimates for the LECZ population by drawing on a newer collection of input data, and provides a range of estimates for at-risk population and land area. Constructing accurate estimates requires high-quality and methodologically consistent input data, and the LECZv3 evaluates multiple data sources for population totals, digital elevation model, and spatially-delimited urban classifications. Users can find the paper \"Estimating Population and Urban Areas at Risk of Coastal Hazards, 1990-2015: How data choices matter\" (MacManus, et al. 2021) in order to evaluate selected inputs for modeling Low Elevation Coastal Zones. According to the paper, the following are considered core data sets for the purposes of LECZv3 estimates: Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain Digital Elevation Model (MERIT-DEM), Global Human Settlement (GHSL) Population Grid R2019 and Degree of Urbanization Settlement Model Grid R2019a v2, and the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4), Revision 11.

For each grid cell that is non-urban in 2000, a Monte-Carlo model assigned a probability of becoming urban by the year 2030. The authors first extracted urban extent circa 2000 from the NASA MODIS Land Cover Type Product Version 5, which provides a conservative estimate of global urban land cover. The authors then used population densities from the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1) to create the population density driver map. They estimated the amount of new urban land in each United Nations region by 2030 in a Monte-Carlo fashion based on present empirical distribution of regional urban population densities and probability density functions of projected regional population and GDP values for 2030. To facilitate integration with other data products, CIESIN reprojected the data from Goode's Homolosine to Geographic WGS84 projection.",

Because of the lack of globally consistent data on migration, indirect estimation methods were used. The authors relied on a combination of data on spatial population distribution for four time slices (1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) and subnational rates of natural increase in order to derive estimates of net migration on a 30 arc-second (~1km) grid cell basis. Net migration was estimated by subtracting the population in time period 2 from the population in time period 1, and then subtracting the natural increase (births minus deaths). The residual was considered to be net migration (in-migrants minus out-migrants).  The authors ran 13 geospatial net migration estimation models based on outputs from the same number of imputation runs for urban and rural rates of natural increase.This data set represents the average of those runs. These data are reliable at broad scales of analysis (e.g. ecosystems or regions), but are generally not reliable for local level analyses. The data were produced for the United Kingdom Foresight project on Migration and Global Environmental Change.",

Mismatches between the spatial extent of the HYDE calculated rates and GRUMPv1 population data were resolved via infilling rate cells based on a focal mean of values.

    "description": "The Global High Resolution Daily Extreme Urban Heat Exposure (UHE-Daily), 1983-2016 data set contains a high-resolution, longitudinal global record of geolocated urban extreme heat events and urban population exposure estimates for more than 10,000 urban settlements worldwide for 1983-2016. Urban extreme heat events and urban population exposure are identified for each urban settlement in the data record for five combined temperature-humidity thresholds: two-day or longer periods where the daily maximum Heat Index (HImax) &gt; 40.6 ï¿½C; one-day or longer periods where HImax &gt; 46.1 ï¿½C; and one day or longer periods where the daily maximum Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGTmax) &gt; 28 ï¿½C, 30 ï¿½C, and 32 ï¿½C. The WBGTmax thresholds follow the International Standards Organization (ISO) criteria for risk of occupational heat related heat illness, whereas the HImax thresholds follow the U.S. National Weather Services' definition for an excessive heat warning. For each criteria, across urban settlements worldwide, the data set also contains the duration, intensity, and severity of each urban extreme heat event.",

The product visualizes changes in both brightness and extent of nocturnal low lights over two decades while minimizing the spatial overextent (overglow) and bright saturation that compromise the DMSP-OLS composites. The map product utilizes annual DMSP-OLS stable lights composites, produced by the NOAA Earth Observation Group and archived at the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), in a tri-temporal global change map. To achieve greater spatial resolution and radiometric accuracy, the DMSP-OLS composites are co-registered and fused with the 2015 VIIRS annual composite from NGDC. The final product therefore retains the spatial detail and dynamic range of the VIIRS product, and the decadal change information from DMSP-OLS images.",

UN SDG 7 is \"ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\". Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report estimated that in 2019, 759 million people around the world lacked access to electricity. Moreover, due to current policies and the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 crisis, it is predicted that by 2030, 660 million people will still not have access to electricity, with a majority of these people residing in Sub-Saharan Africa. As one measure of progress towards SDG 7, the UN agreed upon SDG indicator 7.1.1. The indicator was computed as the proportion of WorldPop gridded population located within illuminated areas defined by annual VIIRS Nighttime Lights Version 2 (VNL V2) data. The SDG indicator 7.1.1 data set provides estimates for the proportion of population with access to electricity for 206 countries and 45,979 level 2 subnational Units.

Over the past ten years, the climate change research commUnity developed a scenario framework combining alternative futures of climate and society to facilitate integrated research and consistent assessment to inform policy. This framework consists of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and Shared Policy Assumptions (SPAs), which together describe alternative visions of how society and climate may evolve over the coming decades, while providing a framework for combining these pathways in integrated studies.

Each data point consists of a city name, latitude, longitude, year, population, and a reliability ranking to assess the geographic uncertainty of each data point. Despite spatial and temporal gaps, no other geocoded data set at this resolution exists.

While the maternal education levels are comparable across countries, owing to different underlying indicators, the household wealth index is not. Education can directly influence risk perception, skills and knowledge and indirectly reduce poverty, improve health, and promote access to information and resources. When facing natural hazards or climate risks, educated individuals, households, and societies are assumed to be more empowered and more adaptive in their response to, preparation for, and recovery from disasters. Education is a key background indicator that helps contextualize a country's health and development situation. The household wealth index is a composite measure of a household's cumulative living standard. The wealth index is calculated using easy-to-collect data on a household's ownership of selected assets, such as televisions and bicycles, materials used for housing construction, and types of water access and sanitation facilities. Bayesian spatial interpolation methods were employed to create country level grids based on DHS cluster point data for each country. Data are from the following dates by country: Benin (2006), Cameroon (2011), Cote d'Ivoire (2012), Ghana (2008), Guinea (2012), Liberia (2011), Nigeria (2010), Sierra Leone (2008), and Togo (1998).",

    "description": "The West Africa Coastal Vulnerability Mapping: Subset of JRC Map of Accessibility data set is a 30 arc-second raster of travel time to major cities in West Africa within 200 kilometers of the coast. Extensive literature shows that road networks and market accessibility play an important role in development and access to health care and other social services. Greater spatial isolation is assumed to produce higher vulnerability to climate stressors. Market accessibility is defined as the travel time to a location of interest using land (road/off road) or water (navigable river, lake, and ocean) based travel. A team at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra, Italy, created a global raster of accessibility using a cost-distance algorithm which computes the \"cost\" (in Units of time) of traveling between two locations on a regular raster grid. The raster grid cells contain values which represent the cost required to travel across them, hence this raster grid is often termed a friction-surface. The friction-surface contains information on the transport network, and environmental and political factors that affect travel times between locations. Transport networks can include road and rail networks, navigable rivers, and shipping lanes. The locations of interest are termed targets, and in the case of this data set, the targets are cities with a population of 50,000 or greater in the year 2000.",

Bryan Jones of Baruch College produced country-level projections based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 4 (SSP4). SSP4 reflects a divided world where cities that have relatively high standards of living, are attractive to internal and international migrants. In low income countries, rapidly growing rural populations live on shrinking areas of arable land due to both high population pressure and expansion of large-scale mechanized farming by international agricultural firms. This pressure induces large migration flow to the cities, contributing to fast urbanization, although urban areas do not provide many opportUnities for the poor and there is a massive expansion of slums and squatter settlements. This scenario may not be the most likely for the West Africa region, but it has internal coherence and is at least plausible.",

Because areas of high population density and growth (high vulnerability) are generally associated with urban areas that have lower levels of poverty and higher degrees of adaptive capacity (low vulnerability), to some degree, the population factors cancel out the poverty and adaptive capacity indicators. To account for this, the data set includes two sub-indices, a Population Exposure Index (PEI), which only includes population density and population growth; and a Poverty and Adaptive Capacity Index (PACI), composed of subnational poverty, maternal education levels, market accessibility, and conflict. These sub-indices are able to isolate the population indicators from the poverty and conflict metrics.

Specifically, the Ce values of peatland, tropical forest, cropland, or savanna and grassland were derived from fire radiative power (FRP) and emission rates of smoke aerosols based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire and aerosol products. FRE for each 0.1-degree interval was calculated from the diurnal FRP cycle that was reconstructed by fusing cloud-corrected FRP retrievals from the high temporal-resolution (10 mins) Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) with those from high spatial-resolution (375 m) VIIRS. This new dataset was named the Fused AHI-VIIRS based fire Emissions (FAVE). Fire emissions data are provided in comma-separated values (CSV) format with one file per month from July 2015 to December 2020. Each file includes variables of fire observation time, fire geographic location, classification, fire radiative energy, various fire emissions and related standard deviations.",

    "description": "The Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) project was established to provide multi-resolution land cover data of the conterminous United States from local to regional scales.  A major component of MRLC is an objective to develop a national 30-meter land cover characteristics data base using Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data.  This is a cooperative effort among six programs within four U.S. Government agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program; the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water Quality Assessment Program; the National Biological Service's Gap Analysis Program; the USGS' Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) Center; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal Change Analysis Program; and the EPA's North American Landscape Characterization project.\n\nMultitemporal scenes were selected for the eastern deciduous forests, agricultural regions, and selected other regions.  Multitemporal pairs were selected to be in consecutive seasons (in 1992 when possible).  All scenes were previewed for image quality.\n\nThe participating agencies organized the joint purchase of a single national set of Landsat TM scenes.  In addition, the cooperators developed a common definition for preprocessing the satellite data.  The shared, consistently processed TM data are the foundation for the development of the national 30-meter land cover data base.  The jointly acquired data are archived and distributed by EROS.  A variety of products are available to MRLC participants, to their affiliated users, and to the general public.\n\nMulti-Resolution Land Characterization 2001 (MRLC 2001) At-Sensor Reflectance Dataset is a second-generation federal consortium to create an updated pool of nation-wide Landsat imagery, and derive a second-generation National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001).\n\nThe MRLC 2001 data cover the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. Multi-temporal scenes may also be available, depending on the location. Most of the images are of high quality, and cloud cover is generally less than ten percent. The data will also include a 30-meter Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for all scenes that do not include the Canadian or Mexican borders.",

Daily estimates, in g C/m2/day, are provided for NEP and stream evasion fluxes. Fluxes for fire emissions, harvest decomposition/respiration, stream evasion, and NEP were derived as described in Section 5.NEE fluxes were estimated using a full bottom-up accounting of NEE produced by integrating emissions from harvested forest and agricultural products, CO2 emitted from streams and rivers, and biomass burning in the CarbonTracker (version 2011_oi) modeling system. NEE estimates were run in the forward mode through the CarbonTracker inversion setup that calculates CO2 uptake and release at the Earth's surface over time. Refer to Turner et al.(2013) for details.There are seven data files in NetCDF (.nc) format with this data set, including: five annual files for fire emissions, harvest decomposition/respiration, stream evasion, NEP, and NEE fluxes; and two daily files for NEP and stream evasion fluxes.",

The DOQ combines the image characteristics of the original photograph with the georeferenced qualities of a map.\n\nDOQs are black and white (B/W), natural color, or color-infrared (CIR) images with 1-meter ground resolution.\n\nThe USGS produces three types of DOQs:\n\n1. 3.75-minute (quarter-quad) DOQs cover an area measuring 3.75-minutes longitude by 3.75-minutes latitude. Most of the U.S. is currently available, and the remaining locations should be complete by 2004. Quarter-quad DOQs are available in both Native and GeoTIFF formats. Native format consists of an ASCII keyword header followed by a series of 8-bit binary image lines for B/W and 24-bit band-interleaved-by-pixel (BIP) for color. DOQs in native format are cast to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and referenced to either the North American Datum (NAD) of 1927 (NAD27) or the NAD of 1983 (NAD83). GeoTIFF format consists of a georeferenced Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), with all geographic referencing information embedded within the .tif file. DOQs in GeoTIFF format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to NAD83. The average file size of a B/W quarter quad is 40-45 megabytes, and a color file is generally 140-150 megabytes. Quarter-quad DOQs are distributed via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) as uncompressed files.\n\n2. 7.5-minute (full-quad) DOQs cover an area measuring 7.5-minutes longitude by 7.5-minutes latitude. Full-quad DOQs are mostly available for Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Limited coverage may also be available for other states. Full-quad DOQs are available in both Native and GeoTIFF formats. Native is formatted with an ASCII keyword header followed by a series of 8-bit binary image lines for B/W. DOQs in native format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to either NAD27 or NAD83. GeoTIFF is a georeferenced Tagged Image File Format with referencing information embedded within the .tif file. DOQs in GeoTIFF format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to NAD83. The average file size of a B/W full quad is 140-150 megabytes. Full-quad DOQs are distributed via FTP as uncompressed files.\n\n3. Seamless DOQs are available for free download from the Seamless site. DOQs on this site are the most current version and are available for the conterminous U.S.\n\n[Summary provided by the USGS.]",

    "description": "The WAVeTrends dataset is a 0.05 degree (5.55 km) vegetation change product, spanning the West African Sudano-Sahel region. It provides pixel-wise information on concurrent woody and herbaceous vegetation trends over a 32-year period (1982-2013). Change in woody vegetation was derived using long-term rain use efficiency (RUE) sensitivity, i.e., the per-pixel comparison of the difference of mean RUE between the first and last decades of the 32-year time series. Herbaceous vegetation change was defined by short-term RUE sensitivity, i.e., comparing the slope of the RUE relationship (productivity vs. precipitation) between both decades using per-pixel Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Categorical vegetation change was then determined for each pixel using the direction of the change and a significance level of p&lt;0.05. The use of RUE (the amount of biomass produced per unit of precipitation) for vegetation trend analysis in savanna regions relies on the assumption that rainfall is a significant positive driver of net production in drylands. Testing of this long-term productivity-rainfall relationship revealed that the assumption was not always met, therefore, validity flags are included for each pixel location.",

The meeting was held during November 14-16, 2018. Yup'ik participants represented several YKD villages that occupy very different biophysical environments, and they have lifelong perspectives of environmental conditions and change that predate the era of Earth-observing satellites by many decades. Nearly 16 hours of discussion and testimonials from YKD elders were recorded during the meeting. The booklet is structured according to the environmental change processes that were discussed (e.g., coastal flooding, permafrost thaw, shrub expansion, climate change) and includes narrative summaries, quotations from participants, graphical illustrations, and examples of the field- and remote-sensing-based scientific findings, and map products developed as part of the larger ABoVE project.",

    "description": "Nitrogen is a major nutrient in terrestrial ecosystems and an important catalyst in tropospheric photochemistry. Over the last century human activities have dramatically increased inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr, the combination of oxidized, reduced and organically bound nitrogen) to the Earth system. Nitrogen cycle perturbations have compromised air quality and human health, acidified ecosystems, and degraded and eutrophied  lakes and coastal estuaries [Vitousek et al., 1997a, 1997b; Rabalais, 2002; Howarth et al., 2003; Townsend et al., 2003; Galloway et al., 2004]. To begin to quantify the changes to the global N cycle, we have assembled key flux data and N2O mixing ratios from various sources.  The data assembled from different sources includes fertilizer production from 1920-2004;  manure production from 1860-2004; crop N fixation estimated for three time points, 1860, 1900, 1995; tropospheric N2O mixing ratios from ice core and firn measurements, and tropospheric concentrations to cover the time period from 1756-2004.  The changing N2O concentrations provide an independent index of changes to the global N cycle, in much the same way that changing carbon dioxide concentrations provide an important constraint on the global carbon cycle.  The changes to the global N cycle are driven by industrialization, as indicated by fossil fuel NOx emission, and by the intensification of agriculture, as indicted by fertilizer and manure production and crop N2 fixation. The data set and the science it reflects are by nature interdisciplinary.  Making the data set available through the ORNL DAAC is an attempt to make the data set available to the considerable interdisciplinary community studying the N cycle.",

    "description": "Satellite fire detection was determined from two sensors, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA-12 and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on both the Terra and Aqua platforms, for 2001- 2003 to characterize fire activity in Brazil, giving special emphasis to the Amazon region. Active fire data for AVHRR/NOAA-12 was produced using a fixed threshold fire detection technique based on the algorithm developed by the Centro de Previsao do Tempo e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC/INPE) (Setzer and Pereira, 1991; Setzer et al., 1994; Setzer and Malingreau, 1996). Active fire data for MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua was produced using a contextual fire detection technique based on NASA-University of Maryland algorithm (Justice et al., 2003; Giglio et al.2003).Resulting fire counts were compared for major biomes of Brazil (Figure 1), the nine states of the Legal Amazon (e.g., Tocantins, Figure 2), and two important road corridors in the Amazon region (Figure 3). In evaluating the daily fire counts, there is a dependence on variations in satellite viewing geometry, overpass time, atmospheric conditions, and fire characteristics (Schroeder et al., 2005). The data provided are the coordinates of daily active vegetation fires in Brazil for 2001 through 2003 at 1km resolution for both AVHRR and MODIS sensors.  Data are provided in both Arcview (shape file format) and ASCII comma separated file formats. Vector files for the major biomes of Brazil, the nine states of the Legal Amazon, and two important road corridors in the Amazon region are also included.",

    "description": "The SAFARI 2000 project was selected as the first regional test for a prototype regional 500 m MODIS burned area product. The MODIS burned area product maps the 500 m location and approximate day of burning using a change detection algorithm based on a bi-directional reflectance model-based expectation method applied to the MODIS near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands (Roy et al., 2002). The algorithm was applied to recently reprocessed 500 m daily MODIS land surface reflectance data to produce burned area data sets for all of southern Africa for 2000 forward. This archived data set contains MODIS 500 m burned area products for two dry season months (July and September 2000).Burned area products are spatially explicit data sets that describe the approximate day of burning at 500 m resolution for all of southern Africa south of the Equator, including Madagascar. The burned area maps are compressed GeoTiff files. Several text files are included in the compressed files to aid ENVI (Research Systems, Inc.) users, including ENVI header files and ENVI density slice files. The data set also includes a projection parameters file.The MODIS burned area data set was validated using a methodology based upon the interpretation of multitemporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) data as described in Roy et al. (in press).",

The objective of GBA2000 was to produce a map of the areas burned globally for the year 2000, using the medium resolution satellite imagery provided by the SPOT-VEGETATION (VGT) system and to derive statistics of area burned per type of vegetation cover. A subset of the global GBA20000 map was prepared for SAFARI 2000 to map the area burned in sub-Saharan Africa during 2000 on a monthly basis using VGT imagery at 1 km spatial resolution. Burned areas were identified with a classification tree, relying only on the near-infrared channel of VGT. The data used in this work are in the S1 daily synthesis format, i.e. the data are radiometrically calibrated, precisely geo-located, and corrected for atmospheric effects.The data are binary image files of area burned, BSQ format in geographic projection.  There is one file for each month of 2000 and one file for all of the year 2000. There is also a comma-delimited ASCII text file that provides geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the center of each pixel indicated as a burned area for all of 2000.",
