    "description": "The Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD17A2HGF Version 6.1 Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) product is a cumulative 8-day composite of values with 500 meter (m) pixel size based on the radiation use efficiency concept that can be potentially used as inputs to data models to calculate terrestrial energy, carbon, water cycle processes, and biogeochemistry of vegetation. The data product includes information about GPP and Net Photosynthesis (PSN). The PSN band values are the GPP less the Maintenance Respiration (MR). The data product also contains a PSN Quality Control (QC) layer. The quality layer contains quality information for both the GPP and the PSN.\n\nThe MOD17A2HGF will be generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MOD15A2H (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/mod15a2h.061) is available. Hence, the gap-filled MOD17A2HGF is the improved MOD17, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from 8-day Leaf Area Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation  (FPAR/LAI) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation. However, users cannot get MOD17A2HGF in near-real time because it will be generated only at the end of a given year.\n\nStage 3 (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/newPage.cgi?fileName=maturity) validation has been achieved for MOD17 products.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The product uses Climatology LAI/FPAR as back up to the operational LAI/FPAR. \n\n\n",

    "description": "Near real-time (NRT) Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Active Fire detection product is based on that instrument's 375 m nominal resolution data. Compared to other coarser resolution (≥1km) satellite fire detection products, the improved 375 m data provide greater response over fires of relatively small areas, as well as improved mapping of large fire perimeters. Consequently, the data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity. The 375 m product complements the baseline Suomi NPP/VIIRS 750 m active fire detection and characterization data, which was originally designed to provide continuity to the existing 1 km Earth Observing System Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (EOS/MODIS) active fire data record. Due to frequent data saturation issues, the current 375 m fire product provides detection information only with no sub-pixel fire characterization.\r\n\r\nVNP14IMGTDL_NRT are available in the following formats: TXT, SHP, KML, WMS.

The VNP13 data products are designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua Vegetation Indices product suite to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission.\r\n\r\nThe VNP13 algorithm process produces three vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI2). NDVI is one of the longest continual remotely sensed time series observations, using both the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. EVI is a slightly different vegetation index that is more sensitive to canopy cover, while NDVI is more sensitive to chlorophyll. EVI2 is a reformation of the standard 3-band EVI, using the red band and NIR band. This reformation addresses arising issues when comparing VIIRS EVI to other EVI models that do not include a blue band. EVI2 will eventually become the standard EVI. \r\n\r\nAlong with the three Vegetation Indices layers, this product also includes layers for NIR reflectance; three shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance; red, blue, and green reflectance; composite day of year; pixel reliability; relative azimuth, view, and sun angles; and a quality layer. Two low resolution browse images are also available for each VNP13A1 product: EVI and NDVI.",

In generating this monthly product, the algorithm ingests all the MYD13A2 (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD13A2.061) products that overlap the month and employs a weighted temporal average. \n\nThe MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes an Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from surface reflectances corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption, and aerosols.\n\nVegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes as well as global and regional climate. Additional applications include characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes, such as primary production and land cover conversion.\n\nProvided along with the vegetation layers and the two quality assurance (QA) layers are reflectance bands 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared), 3 (blue), and 7 (mid-infrared), as well as three observation layers.\n\nValidation at stage 3 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Vegetation Index product suite.

    "description": "This dataset contains Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Level 4A (L4A) Version 2 predictions of the aboveground biomass density (AGBD; in Mg/ha) and estimates of the prediction standard error within each sampled geolocated laser footprint. In this version, the granules are in sub-orbits. The algorithm setting group selection used for GEDI02_A Version 2 has been modified for Evergreen Broadleaf Trees in South America to reduce false positive errors resulting from the selection of waveform modes above ground elevation as the lowest mode. The footprints are located within the global latitude band observed by the International Space Station (ISS), nominally 51.6 degrees N and S and reported for the period 2019-04-18 to 2023-03-16. The GEDI instrument consists of three lasers producing a total of eight beam ground transects, which instantaneously sample eight ~25 m footprints spaced approximately every 60 m along-track. The GEDI beam transects are spaced approximately 600 m apart on the Earth's surface in the cross-track direction, for an across-track width of ~4.2 km. Footprint AGBD was derived from parametric models that relate simulated GEDI Level 2A (L2A) waveform relative height (RH) metrics to field plot estimates of AGBD. Height metrics from simulated waveforms associated with field estimates of AGBD from multiple regions and plant functional types (PFTs) were compiled to generate a calibration dataset for models representing the combinations of world regions and PFTs (i.e., deciduous broadleaf trees, evergreen broadleaf trees, evergreen needleleaf trees, deciduous needleleaf trees, and the combination of grasslands, shrubs, and woodlands). For each of the eight beams, additional data are reported with the AGBD estimates, including the associated uncertainty metrics, quality flags, model inputs, and other information about the GEDI L2A waveform for this selected algorithm setting group. Model inputs include the scaled and transformed GEDI L2A RH metrics, footprint geolocation variables and land cover input data including PFTs and the world region identifiers. Additional model outputs include the AGBD predictions for each of the six GEDI L2A algorithm setting groups with AGBD in natural and transformed units and associated prediction uncertainty for each GEDI L2A algorithm setting group. Providing these ancillary data products will allow users to evaluate and select alternative algorithm setting groups. Also provided are outputs of parameters and variables from the L4A models used to generate AGBD predictions that are required as input to the GEDI04_B algorithm to generate 1-km gridded products.",

The VNP13 data products are designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua Vegetation Indices product suite to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission.\r\n\r\nThe VNP13 algorithm process produces three vegetation indices: The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI2). NDVI is one of the longest continual remotely sensed time series observations, using both the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. EVI is a slightly different vegetation index that is more sensitive to canopy cover, while NDVI is more sensitive to chlorophyll. EVI2 is a reformation of the standard 3-band EVI, using the red band and NIR band. This reformation addresses arising issues when comparing VIIRS EVI to other EVI models that do not include a blue band. EVI2 will eventually become the standard EVI. \r\n\r\nAlong with the three Vegetation Indices layers, this product also includes layers for NIR reflectance; three shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance; red, blue, and green reflectance; composite day of year; pixel reliability; relative azimuth, view, and sun angles, and a quality layer.

    "description": "The Terra and Aqua combined MCD64A1 Version 6.1 Burned Area data product is a monthly, global gridded 500 meter (m) product containing per-pixel burned-area and quality information. The MCD64A1 burned-area mapping approach employs 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Surface Reflectance imagery coupled with 1 kilometer (km) MODIS active fire observations. The algorithm uses a burn sensitive Vegetation Index (VI) to create dynamic thresholds that are applied to the composite data. The VI is derived from MODIS shortwave infrared atmospherically corrected surface reflectance bands 5 and 7 with a measure of temporal texture. The algorithm identifies the date of burn for the 500 m grid cells within each individual MODIS tile. The date is encoded in a single data layer as the ordinal day of the calendar year on which the burn occurred with values assigned to unburned land pixels and additional special values reserved for missing data and water grid cells. \r\n\r\nThe data layers provided in the MCD64A1 product include Burn Date, Burn Data Uncertainty, Quality Assurance, along with First Day and Last Day of reliable change detection of the year. \r\n\r\nValidation at stage 3 ( https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Burned Area product.

For pixels with more than two valid vegetation cycles, the data represent the two cycles with the largest NBAR-EVI2 amplitudes.\n\nProvided in each MCD12Q2 Version 6.1 Hierarchical Data Format 4 (HDF4) file are layers for the total number of vegetation cycles detected for the product year, the onset of greenness, greenup midpoint, maturity, peak greenness, senescence, greendown midpoint, dormancy, EVI2 minimum, EVI2 amplitude, integrated EVI2 over a vegetation cycle, as well as overall and phenology metric-specific quality information. SDS layers may be multi-dimensional with up to two valid vegetation cycles. \n\nFor areas where the NBAR-EVI2 values are missing due to cloud cover or other reasons, the data gaps are filled with good quality NBAR-EVI2 values from the year directly preceding or following the product year.\n\nValidation accuracy (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/newPage.cgi?fileName=maturity) is currently still being evaluated, and a validation statement for this product will be forthcoming once the evaluation is complete.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The MCD12Q2 Version 6.1 product has an improved approach to snow filtering.\n\n\n",

    "description": "The MOD13C1 Version 6.1 product provides a Vegetation Index (VI) value at a per pixel basis. There are two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions.\n\nThe Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) consists 3,600 rows and 7,200 columns of 5,600 meter (m) pixels. Global MOD13C1 data are cloud-free spatial composites of the gridded 16-day 1 kilometer MOD13A2 (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD13A2.061) data, and are provided as a Level 3 product projected on a 0.05 degree (5,600 m) geographic CMG.

    "description": "The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.\n\nAn overview of NCA-LDAS and its capability for developing climate change indicators are provided in Jasinski et al. (2019).  Details on the data assimilation used in NCA-LDAS are described in Kumar et al. (2019).  Sample mean annual trends are provided in the NCA-LDAS V2.0 README document.\n\nThis NCA-LDAS version 2.0 data product was simulated for the continental United States for the satellite era from January 1979 to December 2016. The core of NCA-LDAS is the multivariate assimilation of past and current satellite based data records within the Noah Version 3.3 land-surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution using NASA's Land Information System (LIS; Kumar et al. 2006) software framework during the Earth observing satellite era. The temporal resolution is daily. NCA-LDAS V001 data will no longer be available and have been superseded by V2.0.\n\nNCA-LDAS includes 42 variables including land-surface fluxes (e.g. precipitation, radiation and latent and sensible heat, etc.), stores (e.g. soil moisture and snow), states (e.g., surface temperature), and routing variables (e.g., runoff, streamflow, flooded area, etc.), driven by the atmospheric forcing data from North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2; Xia et al., 2012). NCA-LDAS builds upon NLDAS through the addition of multivariate assimilation of earth observations such as soil moisture (Kumar et al, 2014), snow (Liu et al, 2015; Kumar et al, 2015a) and irrigation (Ozdagon et al, 2010; Kumar et al, 2015b). The EDRs that have been assimilated into the NCA-LDAS include soil moisture and snow depth from principally microwave sensors including SMMR, SSM/I, AMSR-E, ASCAT, AMSR-2, SMOS, and SMAP, irrigation intensity estimates from MODIS, and snow covered area from MODIS and from the multisensor IMS snow product.",

ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECO4WUE Version 1 data product provides Water Use Efficiency (WUE) data generated according to the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) algorithm described in the ECOSTRESS Level 4 WUE Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/346/ECO4WUE_ATBD_V1.pdf). WUE is the ratio of carbon stored by plants to water evaporated by plants. This ratio is given as grams of carbon stored per kilogram of water evaporated over the course of the day from sunrise to sunset on the day when the ECOSTRESS granule was acquired.\r\n\r\nThe ECO4WUE Version 1 data product contains a single layer of water use efficiency. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

    "description": "The MYD13C2 Version 6.1 product provides a Vegetation Index (VI) value at a per pixel basis. There are two primary vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions.\n\nThe Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) consists of 3,600 rows and 7,200 columns of 5,600 meter (m) pixels. In generating this monthly product, the algorithm ingests all the MYD13A2 (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD13A2.061) products that overlap the month and employs a weighted temporal average. Global MYD13C1 data are cloud-free spatial composites and are provided as a Level 3 product projected on a 0.05 degree (5,600 m) geographic CMG. The MYD13C2 has data fields for the NDVI, EVI, VI QA, reflectance data, angular information, and spatial statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and number of used input pixels at the 0.05 degree CMG resolution. \n\n\nValidation at stage 3 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Vegetation Index product suite. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the MOD13 data products are available from the MODIS Land Team Validation site (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/ValStatus.php?ProductID=MOD13).\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).",

The VCF5KYR data product is derived from a bagged linear model algorithm using Long Term Data Record Version 4 (LTDR V4) data compiled from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is the ratio of the area of the vertical projection of green vegetation above ground to the total area, capturing the horizontal distribution and density of vegetation on the Earth’s surface. FVC is a primary means for measuring global forest cover change and is a key parameter for a variety of environmental and climate-related applications, including carbon land surface models and biomass measurements.

Biophysical Parameters derived from the FASIR-NDVI (Fourier Adjusted, Solar zenith angle correction, Interpolation, and Reconstruction of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data set developed for the ISLSCP Initiative II data collection for the months of January 1982 through December 1998 were used to calculate monthly mean surface albedos at 1 X 1 degree spatial resolution for vegetated land surfaces (Sellers et al, 1996b) for the wavelength interval from 0.4 to 3.0 mm. The instantaneous albedo is a function of the properties of the land surface and the solar zenith angle. The monthly mean albedo is an average weighted over time weighted by the incident radiation. NDVI data are used to generate the biophysical parameters leaf area index (LAI) and green fraction of vegetation (Greenness) used by the canopy radiative transfer model of the Simple Biosphere (SiB2) model (Sellers et al, 1996a), which computes the instantaneous albedo. This is coupled to the Colorado State University (CSU) General Circulation Model (GCM) (Randall et al, 1989) which integrates the SiB2 radiative transfer through time. The incident radiation for weighting the time-averaged albedo was provided by a previous run of the GCM using the atmospheric radiation parameterization of Harshvardhan et al (1987). The Harshvardhan parameterization models radiative transfer through the atmosphere in both the longwave and shortwave bands, including the effects of cloudiness and water vapor, carbon dioxide and ozone. The shortwave radiation distinguishes between the direct and diffuse components of the solar beam.",

The two datasets have been integrated to capitalize on the unique strengths of each product's characteristics.   \r\n\r\nThe integration steps include: adjustment of ASTER GED Version 3 emissivities for vegetation and snow cover variations to produce ASTER GED Version 4, aggregation of ASTER GED Version 4 emissivities from 100 meter resolution to the University of Wisconsin-Madison MODIS Baseline Fit (UWBF) 5 kilometer resolution, merging of the 5 ASTER spectral emissivities with the UWBF emissivity to create CAMEL at 13 hinge points, and extension of the 13 hinge points to high spectral resolution (HSR) utilizing the Principal Component (PC) regression method. Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the User Guide and Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/219/cam5k30_v2_user_guide_atbd.pdf).\r\n\r\nProvided in the CAM5K30EM product are layers for the CAMEL emissivity, ASTER Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), snow fraction derived from MODIS (MOD10), latitude, longitude, CAMEL quality, ASTER quality, and Best Fit Emissivity (BFE) quality information.\r\n\r\n",

The VNP13 data products are designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua Vegetation Indices product suite to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission.\r\n\r\nThe VNP13 algorithm process produces three vegetation indices: The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI2). NDVI is one of the longest continual remotely sensed time series observations, using both the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. EVI is a slightly different vegetation index that is more sensitive to canopy cover, while NDVI is more sensitive to chlorophyll. EVI2 is a reformation of the standard 3-band EVI, using the red band and NIR band. This reformation addresses arising issues when comparing VIIRS EVI to other EVI models that do not include a blue band. EVI2 will eventually become the standard EVI. \r\n\r\nAlong with the three Vegetation Indices layers, this product also includes layers for the standard deviations of each Vegetation Index; NIR reflectance; three shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance; red, blue, and green reflectance; number of pixels, number of pixels used; pixel reliability; average sun angle, and a quality layer.

The Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data product includes information about GPP and Net Photosynthesis (PSN). The PSN band values are the GPP less the Maintenance Respiration (MR). The data product also contains a PSN Quality Control (QC) layer. The quality layer contains quality information for both the GPP and the PSN.\n\nThe MYD17A2HGF will be generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MYD15A2H (https://doi.org/10.5067/modis/myd15a2h.061) is available.

If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation.

Specifically, the resampled DISCover datasets were derived from the 1km DISCover data set compiled by the USGS. The 1km data sets for each classification scheme were aggregated to 1, 0.5 and 0.25 degree spatial resolutions for this ISLSCP II data collection. Each layer of the aggregated products corresponds to a single DISCover land cover category and the values represent the percentage of the coarse resolution cell (1 degree, etc...)occupied by that land cover category. The dominant class data show the land cover category that occupies the majority of the cell and is derived from the percentage files for each cover type. The objective of this study was to create a land cover map derived from 1 kilometer AVHRR data using a full year of data (April 1992-March 1993). This thematic map was resampled to 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree grids for the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) data initiative II. During this re-processing, the original EDC land cover type and fraction maps were adjusted to match the water/land fraction of the ISLSCP II land/water mask. These maps were generated for use by global modelers and others. This data set is one of the products of the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP II) data collection which contains 50 global time series data sets for the ten-year period 1986 to 1995. Selected data sets span even longer periods. ISLSCP II is a consistent collection of data sets that were compiled from existing data sources and algorithms, and were designed to satisfy the needs of modelers and investigators of the global carbon, water and energy cycle. The data were acquired from a number of U.S. and international agencies, universities, and institutions. The global data sets were mapped at consistent spatial (1, 0.5 and 0.25 degrees) and temporal (monthly, with meteorological data at finer (e.g., 3-hour)) resolutions and reformatted into a common ASCII format. The data and documentation have undergone two peer reviews.ISLSCP is one of several projects of Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) [http://www.gewex.org/] and has the lead role in addressing land-atmosphere interactions -- process modeling, data retrieval algorithms, field experiment design and execution, and the development of global data sets.",

    "description": "This dataset provides a global 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree gridded monthly mean leaf area index (LAI) climatology as averaged over the period from August 1981 to August 2015. The data were derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) LAI3g version 2, a bi-weekly data product from 1981 to 2015 (GIMMS-LAI3g version 2). The LAI3g version 2 (raw) data were first regridded from 1/12 x 1/12 degree to 0.25 x 0.25 degree resolution, then processed to remove missing and unreasonable values, scaled to obtain LAI values, and the bi-weekly LAI values were averaged for every month. Finally, the monthly long-term mean LAI (1981-2015) was calculated.",

    "description": "The daily NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Burned Area (VNP64A1) Version 1 data product is a monthly, global gridded 500-meter (m) product containing per-pixel burned area and quality information. The VNP64 burned area mapping approach employs 750 m VIIRS imagery coupled with 750 m VIIRS active fire observations. The hybrid algorithm applies dynamic thresholds to composite imagery generated from a burn-sensitive Vegetation Index (VI) derived from VIIRS shortwave infrared channels M8 and M11, and a measure of temporal texture. VIIRS bands that are both sensitive and insensitive to biomass burning are used to detect changes caused by fire and to differentiate them from other types of change. The mapping algorithm ultimately identifies the date of burn, to the nearest day, for 500 m grid cells within the individual sinusoidal tile being processed. The date is encoded in a single data layer of the output product as the ordinal day of the calendar year on which the burn occurred (range 1–366), with a value of 0 for unburned land pixels and additional values reserved for missing data and water grid cells. The VNP64A1 data product is designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua combined burned area product to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. \r\n\r\nVNP64A1 has been released on a limited basis due to concerns over the quality of the data along the edges of inland water bodies and at high latitudes. These regions contain grid cells falsely identified as burned as a result of coarse resolution inputs to the cloud mask used in the generation of the 750 m VIIRS active fire observations. Users are urged to exercise caution when using this provisional (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/NPP_QA/NPPpage.cgi?fileName=maturity&amp;subdir=forPage) data in research. The Version 2 burned area product generated with an improved cloud mask is scheduled for release in the summer of 2020.\r\n\r\nThe data layers provided in the VNP64A1 product include Burn Date, Burn Date Uncertainty, and Quality Assurance (QA), along with First Day and Last Day of reliable change detection of the year. A low resolution browse is also provided showing the burned date layer with a color map applied in JPEG format.\r\n\r\nNotification:  VIIRS/NPP Burned Area Monthly L4 Global 500 m SIN Grid data product has been released on a limited basis due to falsely identified burned areas.\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "SiB3 Modeled Global 1-degree Hourly Biosphere-Atmosphere Carbon Flux, 1998-2006",
    "description": "The Simple Biosphere Model, Version 3 (SiB3) was used to produce a global data set of hourly carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere for the years 1998-2006. This data set represents the global net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere; specifically, the flux of CO2 between the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the surface vegetation layer. Following atmospheric convention, flux is defined as positive into the atmosphere and negative into the surface vegetation.The data reported are 9 years of estimated hourly carbon flux for 14637 land points. Units are moles C/m2/sec.Data are provided in two NetCDF formats: The NetCDF format provided by the investigators -- format designed specifically to minimize disk storage volume that excludes water grid cells, and  A CF Compliant NetCDF format -- generated by the ORNL DAAC that includes both land and water grid cells.The investigator provided NetCDF formatted files can be processed using the provided  FORTRAN code (sib_process_flux.f90) and the land mask (sib_mask.nc) into hourly, daily-mean, or monthly-mean fluxes on a global 1x1 degree Cartesian grid. The monthly-mean SiB3 fluxes were compared to TransCom flux data available for years 2000-2005 (Gurney et al., 2008) as a means of evaluating overall behavior of the model. In general, SiB3 fluxes are within the error bars of the TransCom results.The CF compliant NetCDF format files have been processed by the ORNL DAAC and the hourly and summarized daily-mean and monthly-mean flux data files are provided. GeoTIFF format files:In addition, the CF convention NetCDF files were converted to GeoTIFF image files by the ORNL DAAC and are included with the data set. Companion file:Additional information about the data formats, methodology, and data quality is found in the companion file: SiB3_carbon_flux_readme.pdfAccess to GeoTIFF format files via WCS Interface:The ORNL DAAC also provides access to the GeoTIFF files via a Web Coverage Service Interface (WCS). The OpenGIS Web Coverage Service Interface Standard (WCS) defines a standard interface and operations that enables interoperable access to geospatial coverages.These data are a carbon cycle reanalysis, which may be thought of as analogous to NCEP meteorological reanalysis products. Carbon fluxes have been used by a large community of atmospheric transport modelers to create reanalysis of CO2 concentrations and the results have been evaluated against observations. In addition, the reanalyzed flux and CO2 fields are important for designing future observing strategies for the global carbon cycle.",

    "description": "This data set provides normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for the arctic growing season derived primarily with data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors onboard several NOAA satellites over the years 1982 through 2012. The NDVI data, which show vegetation activity, were averaged annually for the arctic growing season (GS; June, July and August). The products include the annual GS-NDVI values and the results of a cumulative GS-NDVI time series trends analysis. The data are circumpolar in coverage at 8-km resolution and limited to greater than 20 degrees N.These normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) trends were calculated using the third generation data set from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS 3g). GIMMS 3g improves on its predecessor (GIMMS g) in three important ways. First, GIMMS 3g integrates data from NOAA-17 and 18 satellites to lengthen its record. Second, it addresses the spatial discontinuity north of 72 degrees N, by using SeaWiFS, in addition to SPOT VGT, to calibrate between the second and third versions of the AVHRR sensor (AVHRR/2 and AVHRR/3). Finally, the GIMMS 3g algorithm incorporates improved snowmelt detection and is calibrated based on data from the shorter, arctic growing season (May-September) rather than the entire year (January-December).

    "description": "This data set provides global leaf area index (LAI) values for woody species. The data are a compilation of field-observed data from 1,216 locations obtained from 554 literature sources published between 1932 and 2011. Only site-specific maximum LAI values were included from the sources; values affected by significant artificial treatments (e.g. continuous fertilization and/or irrigation) and LAI values that were low due to drought or disturbance (e.g. intensive thinning, wildfire, or disease), or because vegetation was immature or old/declining, were excluded (Lio et al., 2014). To maximize the generic applicability of the data, original LAI values from source literature and values standardized using the definition of half of total surface area (HSA) are included. Supporting information, such as geographical coordinates of plot, altitude, stand age, name of dominant species, plant functional types, and climate data are also provided in the data file. There is one data file in comma-separated (.csv) format with this data set and one companion file which provides the data sources.",

The monitoring of global cropland extent is critical for policymaking and provides important baseline data that are used in many agricultural cropland studies pertaining to water sustainability and food security. The GFSAD30SEACE data product uses the pixel-based supervised classifiers, Random Forest (RF), to retrieve cropland extent from a combination of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and elevation derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Version 3 data products. Each GFSAD30SEACE GeoTIFF file contains a cropland extent layer that defines areas of cropland, non-cropland, and water bodies over a 10° by 10° area.\r\n",

    "description": "The Historical Croplands Cover data set was developed to understand the consequences of historical changes in land use and land cover for ecosystem goods and services. In particular, this data set can be used to study how global changes in cultivated area has influenced climate, biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, etc. This data set can be used directly within spatially-explicit climate and biogeochemical models.This is a gridded data set describing the fraction of each grid cell in the globe that is occupied by cultivated land from 1700 to 1992. Data layers are provided for every 50 years from 1700 to 1850, every 10 years from 1850 to 1980, and every year from 1986 to 1992.There are two sources of global land cover/land use data. The most recent estimates are derived from satellite measurements, and are available in a spatially-explicit fashion for roughly the last 30 years. The other estimate is based on ground-based sources such as census statistics, land surveys, estimates by historical geographers, etc. These land inventory data are only available at the scale of political units, but have the advantage of being historical. Ramankutty and Foley (1998) derived a spatially-explicit data set of croplands in 1992 by synthesizing remotely-sensed land cover data with contemporary land inventory data. Furthermore, Ramankutty and Foley (1999) extended this data set into the past (back to 1700) using historical land inventory data.The data set should only be used for continental-to-global scale analysis and modeling. The data set captures the broad patterns of cropland change over history, but not necessarily the fine details at local to regional scales - please check the data quality before using it at fine spatial scales. The quality of historical data for the Russian Federation is poor. The quality of data prior to 1850 is poor -- only continental-scale historical data were used for that period. ",

    "description": "The VIIRS/NPP Thermal Anomalies/Fire 6-Min L2 Swath 750m NRT product is based on the MODIS C6 Fire algorithm. The input to the Active Fires production are Level-1B moderate-resolution reflective band M7, and emissive bands M13 and M15. The fire algorithm first calculates bands M13, M15 brightness temperature (BT) statistics for a group of background pixels adjacent to each potential fire pixel. These statistics are used to set thresholds for several contextual fire detection tests. There is also an absolute fire detection test based on a pre-set M13 BT threshold. If the results of the absolute and relative fire detection tests meet certain criteria, the pixel is labeled as fire. The designation of a pixel as fire from the results of the BT threshold tests may be overridden under sun glint conditions or if too few pixels were used to calculate the background statistics.\n\nThe VNP14_NRT product contains several pieces of information for each fire pixel: pixel coordinates, latitude and longitude, pixel M7 reflectance, background M7 reflectance, pixel M13 and M15 BT, background M13 and M15 BT, mean background BT difference, background M13, M15, and BT difference mean absolute deviation, fire radiative power, number of adjacent cloud pixels, number of adjacent water pixels, background window size, number of valid background pixels, detection confidence, land pixel flag, background M7 reflectance, and reflectance mean absolute deviation.\n\nThe product provides day and nighttime active fire detection over land and water (from gas flares). The VNP14 product provides fire data continuity with NASA's EOS MODIS 1 km fire product. \n\nFor more information visit University of Maryland VIIRS Active Fire Web page at http://viirsfire.geog.umd.edu/",

The data set describes historical land use changes over a 300-year historical period (1700-1990).Testing against historical data is an important step for validating integrated models of global environmental change. Owing to long time lags in the climate and biogeochemical systems, these models should aim to simulate the land use dynamics for long periods, i.e., spanning decades to centuries. Developing such models requires an understanding of past and current trends and is therefore strongly data dependent. For this purpose, a historical database of the global environment has been developed: HYDE. Historical statistical inventories on agricultural land (census data, tax records, land surveys, etc) and different spatial analysis techniques were used to create a geographically-explicit data set of land use change, with a regular time interval.

    "description": "This data set provides global monthly wetland methane (CH4) emissions and uncertainty data products derived from an ensemble of multiple terrestrial biosphere models, wetland extent scenarios, and CH4:C temperature dependencies. The data are at 0.5 by 0.5-degree resolution. Two model output data products are included in WetCHARTs v1.0: an output from the full ensemble for 2009-2010 and an output from a limited subset for 2001-2015. The intended use of the products is as a process-informed wetland CH4 emission and uncertainty data set for atmospheric chemistry and transport modelling (WetCHARTs).",

    "title": "Global Monthly GPP from an Improved Light Use Efficiency Model, 1982-2016",
    "description": "This dataset provides global monthly average gross primary productivity (GPP; g carbon/m2/d) modeled at 8 km spatial resolution for each of the 35 years from 1982-2016. GPP is based on the well-known Monteith light use efficiency (LUE) equation but was improved with optimized spatially and temporally explicit LUE values derived from selected FLUXNET tower site data. Optimized LUE was extrapolated to a consistent 8 km resolution global grid using multiple explanatory variables representing climatic, landscape, and vegetation factors influencing LUE and GPP. Global gridded long-term daily GPP was derived using the optimized LUE, Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS3g) canopy fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, (MERRA-2) meteorological information. These data will improve satellite-based estimation and understanding of GPP using a refined LUE model framework.",
