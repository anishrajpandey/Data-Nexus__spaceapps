The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface has been observed. An indication of shadows affecting the scene is also provided. Radiometrically-accurate radiances are required, thus holes in the Cloud Mask will appear wherever the input radiances are incomplete or of poor quality assurance.\r\n\r\nFor more information consult Product Page at: \r\nhttps://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/MVCM/",

In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme. \nThe CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates.

    "description": "WARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.  The CLIMCAPS algorithm uses data from the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) as a first-guess for the atmospheric state.  Because MERRA-2 products typically have a latency from 3 to 7 weeks, so too do the CLIMCAPS products. \n\nA level 2 granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.\n\n",

    "description": "\nWARNING: On 2021/09/23 the EOS Aqua executed a Deep Space Maneuver (DSM). In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.\n\nThe thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the “spectral_freq” parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts. Approximately 1803 channels have BT shifts of less than 0.1 K and 575 channels are now shifted in BT by more than 0.1 K, while 231 of these channels have BT shifts greater than 0.2 K.\n\nUsers of the L1b v5 product who are concerned that these shifts may impact their science investigations and applications are encouraged to switch to the AIRS L1c v6.7.4 product, which, among many other improvements, converts the spectra to a fixed frequency grid.          END OF WARNING.\n\n\n\nThe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua.

The AIRS instrument is co-aligned with AMSU-A so that successive blocks of 3 x 3 AIRS footprints are contained within one AMSU-A footprint.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.\n\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  Late Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDL) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHL. The derived result represents a Late expedited estimate of the daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHHL and giving the result in (mm). The latency of the derived late daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHL for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHL is 12 hours, the daily should appear about 12 hours after the closure of the UTC day.

In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\n\nThe following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.\n\nThe daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nwhere:\nPdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)\nPi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\n\nOn occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the \"true\" daily total. These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which\n Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.\n\n\nThere are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:\n\nPerr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)\nNcnt_err\t- The counts for the error variable\n\nThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:\n\nrms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)\n\n\nThis estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.\n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.\n\nThe 3-hourly data product was simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask. Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values. The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README. The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone.

The MCD19A2 product provides the atmospheric properties and view geometry used to calculate the MAIAC Land Surface Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) or surface reflectance, MCD19A1 product.\r\n\r\nThe MCD19A2 AOD data product contains the following Science Dataset (SDS) layers: blue band AOD at 0.47 µm, green band AOD at 0.55 µm, AOD uncertainty, fine mode fraction over water, column water vapor over land and clouds (in cm), smoke injection height (m above ground), AOD QA, AOD model at 1km, cosine of solar zenith angle, cosine of view zenith angle, relative azimuth angle, scattering angle, and glint angle at 5km. A low-resolution browse image is also included showing AOD of the blue band at 0.47 µm created using a composite of all available orbits.\r\n\r\nEach SDS layer within each MCD19A2 Hierarchical Data Format 4 (HDF4) file contains a third dimension that represents the number of orbit overpasses.

    "title": "NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V002 (NLDAS_FORA0125_H) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This data set contains the primary forcing data \"File A\" for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2).  The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format is WMO GRIB-1. \n\nDetails about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing data sets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). \n\nThe non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).  NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between the NARR and\nNLDAS fields of terrain height.  This vertical adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.  The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are those employed in NLDAS-1, as presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).\n\nThe surface downward shortwave radiation field in \"File A\" is a bias-corrected field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave radiation.  This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in \"File A\" is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).\n\nThe precipitation field in \"File A\" is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology.  The precipitation is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order).  The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.  The field in \"File A\" that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in \"File B\"): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from NARR.\n\nThe hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two GRIB files, \"File A\" and \"File B\".  \"File A\" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven fields.  The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units. \n\nFor more information, please see the README Document.",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06B.\n\nThe precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.\n\nThe CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nCurrently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\nBriefly describing the Final Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then \"forward/backward morphed\" and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields, and adjusted with seasonal GPCP SG surface precipitation data to provide half-hourly and monthly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe. Precipitation phase is computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. The current period of record is June 2000 to the present (delayed by about 3.5 months).\n\n\n",

The AIRS Only Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time.

A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECO4ESIPTJPL Version 1 data product provides Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) data generated according to the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) algorithm described in the ECOSTRESS Level 4 (ESI_PT-JPL) Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/342/ECO4ESIPTJPL_ATBD_V1.pdf). The ESI product is derived from the ratio of the Level 3 actual evapotranspiration (ET) to potential ET (PET) calculated as part of the algorithm. The ESI is an indicator of potential drought and plant water stress emphasizing areas of sub-optimal plant productivity.\r\n\r\nThe ECO4ESIPTJPL Version 1 data product contains layers of ESI and PET.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

    "description": "The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team. \n\nVersion 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.\n\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Final* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH. The derived result represents the final estimate of the Daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHH and giving the result in (mm). \n\nThe latency of the derived *Final* Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG *Final* Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with 2-3 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2. \n\nIn the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields.

The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nCurrently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\n\n\nThe following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.\n\nThe daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nwhere:\nPdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)\nPi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\n\nOn occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the \"true\" daily total. These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which\n Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.\n\n\nThere are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:\n\nPerr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)\nNcnt_err\t- The counts for the error variable\n\nThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:\n\nrms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)\n\n\nThis estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.\n\n\n",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Infrared (IR) level 1C data set contains AIRS infrared calibrated and geolocated radiances in W/m2/micron/ster. This data set is generated from AIRS level 1B data. The spectral coverage of L1C data is from 3.74 to 15.4 mm. The nominal spectral resolution lambda / delta lambda = 1200. The spectrum is sampled twice per spectral resolution element in a total of 2645 spectral channels. A day of AIRS data is divided into 240 granules (scenes) each of 6-minute duration. For the AIRS IR measurements, an individual granule contains 135 pixels across-track and 90 along-track pixels; there are total of 135 x 90 = 12,150 pixels per granule. AIRS employs a 49.5 degree crosstrack scanning with a 1.1 degree instantaneous field of view (IFOV) to provide twice daily coverage of essentially the entire globe in a 1:30 PM sun synchronous orbit with the 13.5 x 13.5 km2 spatial resolution at nadir. The L1C swath products are derived from the L1B swath products. The primary purpose of the level 1C is to generate the spectra of radiances without spectral gaps caused by the instrument design and bad spectral points. The AIRS L1C data can be used for comparative (with other IR measurements) studies and for weather-climate research.\n\nThis is the latest version of this collection.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06B.\n\nThe precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme. The CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nCurrently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\nBriefly describing the Final Run, the input precipitation estimates computed from the various satellite passive microwave sensors are intercalibrated to the CORRA product (because it is presumed to be the best snapshot TRMM/GPM estimate after adjustment to the monthly GPCP SG), then \"forward/backward morphed\" and combined with microwave precipitation-calibrated geo-IR fields, and adjusted with seasonal GPCP SG surface precipitation data to provide half-hourly and monthly precipitation estimates on a 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) grid over the globe. Precipitation phase is computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. The current period of record is June 2000 to the present (delayed by about 3.5 months).\n\n\n",

    "title": "GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 0.25 x 0.25 degree V2.1 (GLDAS_NOAH025_M) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is GLDAS-2.1 Noah monthly 0.25 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version. \n\nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency&amp;#8217;s AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

The dataset covers the period from January 1, 1980, to December 31 (or December 30 in leap years) of the most recent full calendar year for the Continental North America and Hawaii spatial regions. Data for Puerto Rico is available starting in 1950. Each subsequent year is processed individually at the close of a calendar year. Daymet variables are provided as individual files, by variable and year, at a 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution and a daily temporal resolution. Areas of Hawaii and Puerto Rico are available as files separate from the continental North America. Data are in a North America Lambert Conformal Conic projection and are distributed in a standardized Climate and Forecast (CF)-compliant netCDF file format. In Version 4 R1 (ver 4.4), all 2020 and 2021 files were updated to improve predictions especially in high-latitude areas. It was found that input files used for deriving 2020 and 2021 data had, for a significant portion of Canadian weather stations, missing daily variable readings for the month of January. NCEI has corrected issues with the Environment Canada ingest feed which led to the missing readings. The revised 2020 and 2021 Daymet V4 R1 files were derived with new GHCNd inputs.

GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).

The GLDAS-2.2 data are available in two production streams: one with GRACE data assimilation outputs (the main production stream), and one without GRACE-DA (the early production stream).  Since the GRACE data have a 2-6 month latency, the GLDAS-2.2 data are first created without GRACE-DA, and are designated as the Early Product (EP), with about 1 month latency.  Once the GRACE data become available, the GLDAS-2.2 data are processed with GRACE-DA in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Product archive.  \n\nThe GLDAS-2.2 GRACE-DA product was simulated with Catchment-F2.5 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.

    "description": "TMPA (3B42_Daily) dataset have been discontinued as of Dec. 31, 2019, and users are strongly encouraged to shift to the successor IMERG dataset (doi: 10.5067/GPM/IMERGDF/DAY/06).\n\nThis daily accumulated precipitation product is generated from the research-quality 3-hourly TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis TMPA (3B42). It is produced at the NASA GES DISC, as a value added product.  Simple summation of valid retrievals in a grid cell is applied for the data day. The result is given in (mm). The beginning and ending time for every daily granule are listed in the file global attributes, and are taken correspondingly from the first and the last 3-hourly granules participating in the aggregation. Thus the time period covered by one daily granule amounts to 24 hours, which can be inspected in the file global attributes. \n\nCounts of valid retrievals for the day are provided for every variable, making it possible to compute conditional and unconditional mean precipitation for grid cells where less than 8 retrievals for the day are available.\n\nEfforts have been made to make the format of this  derived product as similar as possible to the new Global Precipitation Measurement CF-compliant file format.\n\nThe information provided here on the TRMM mission, and on the original 3-hr 3B42 product, remain relevant for this derived product. Note, however, this product is in netCDF-4 format.\n\n\n\nThe following describes the derivation in more details.\n\nThe daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 3-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 3 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily     = 3 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nwhere:\nPdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)\nPi              - 3-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of 3-hourly files per day, Nf=8\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\n\nOn occasion, the 3-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the \"true\" daily total. These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which\n Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.\n\n\nThere are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 3-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 3-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 3 is finally applied:\n\nPerr_daily = 3 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)\nNcnt_err\t- The counts for the error variable\n\nThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 3-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, accumulates first within the 3-hour period of the source data, and then continues to accumulate during the day. These values, however, can easily be converted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:\n\nrms_err =   { (Perr_daily/3) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)\n\n\nThis estimate assumes that the error given in the 3-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 3-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.\n\n\n",

    "title": "GPM IMERG Early Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V06 (GPM_3IMERGDE) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.\n\nVersion 06 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.\n\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Early* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDE) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHE. The derived result represents an early (expedited) estimate of the daily accumulated precipitation. The dataset is produced at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC) by simply summing the valid precipitation retrievals for the day in GPM_3IMERGHHE and giving the result in (mm). The latency of the derived Early daily product is a couple of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHE for the UTC data day is received at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHE is 4 hours, the daily should appear about 4 hours after the closure of the UTC day. For information on the original data (GPM_3IMERGHHE), please see the Documentation (Related URL). \n\nIn the original IMERG algorithm, the precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2017 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2017), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated merged PMW estimates are then input to both the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing-Kalman Filter (CMORPH-KF) Lagrangian time interpolation scheme and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) re-calibration scheme. In parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the CMORPH-KF morphing (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.\n\nThe CMORPH-KF morphing (supported by an asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create half-hourly estimates. The motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing the pattern correlation of successive hours of the vertically integrated vapor (TQV) provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5) Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The KF uses the morphed data as the “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\" multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\", satellite-gauge product ~3.5 months after the observation month, using both forward and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nCurrently, the near-real-time Early and Late half-hourly estimates have no concluding calibration, while in the post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data, selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated precipitation, precipitationCal, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\n\nThe following describes the derivation of the Daily in more details.\n\nThe daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 0.5-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 0.5 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                \nPdaily     = 0.5 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nwhere:\nPdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)\nPi              - 0.5-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of 0.5-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\n\nOn occasion, the 0.5-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells.

These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which\n Pdaily_cnt less than  Nf.\n\n\nThere are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 0.5-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 0.5-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 0.5 is finally applied:\n\nPerr_daily = 0.5 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)\nNcnt_err\t- The counts for the error variable\n\nThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 0.5-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 0.5-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:\n\nrms_err =   { (Perr_daily/0.5) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)\n\n\nThis estimate assumes that the error given in the 0.5-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 0.5-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.\n\n\n",

The FLDAS regional monthly datasets will no longer be available and have been superseded by the global monthly dataset. \n\nThe simulation was forced by a combination of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) 6-hourly rainfall data that has been downscaled using the NASA Land Data Toolkit.\n\nThe simulation was initialized on January 1, 1982 using soil moisture and other state fields from a FLDAS/Noah model climatology for that day of the year.\n\nIn November 2020, all FLDAS data were&nbsp;post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask. &nbsp;Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.&nbsp; The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect&nbsp;the meteorological forcing variables. More information on this can be found in the FLDAS README document, and the MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the FLDAS Project site.

Inter-instrument radiometric offsets are removed with SNPP-CrIS chosen as the \"standard\".  CHIRP follows the original instrument storage, i.e., granule in, granule out, and contains all information needed for retrievals (including cross-track, along-track, fov id, etc.). This version of CHIRP, SNDR13CHRP1, is the primary CHIRP product which provides a full radiance record from 2002 onwards starting with AIRS from September 1, 2002 to August 30, 2016, switching to the SNPP CrIS instrument on September 1, 2016.  The SNDR13CHRP1 product then switches to using JPSS-1 CrIS radiances starting September 1, 2018.  This selection of time periods provides the best match to times when the microwave sounders on each of these platforms exhibited good performance and avoids long outages (such as SNPP CrIS in early Spring 2019).  CHIRP is available for AIRS, CrIS-SNPP, and CrIS-JPSS-1 for time periods not used in the product distributed here, and are named SNDR13CHRP1AQCal, SNDR13CHRP1SNCal, and SNDR13CHRP1J1Cal respectively.

The NMC data product includes temperature (Kelvin), humidity (%), geopotential height (m), and zonal and meridional wind components (m/s).\n\nGeopotential height and atmospheric temperature data are derived from two analysis systems: 1) tropospheric fields from 1000 to 100 mb, and 2) stratospheric analyses from 70 to 0.4 mb. The tropospheric fields are the 12 GMT gridded fields which are part of the Global Daily Assimilation System (GDAS), where data from radiosondes, aircraft, satellites, ships, bouys, or any other conventional means are assimilated and merged into meteorological fields (heights, temperature, winds). The stratospheric analyses are 12 GMT operational analyses at the 70 - 0.4 mb pressure levels produced from satellite temperature retrievals and RAOBS via a modified Cressman analysis. Tropospheric temperature analyses use combined NOAA-10 and NOAA-11 data. Moisture (northern hemisphere only) and Winds data are obtained from the NMC GDAS.\n\nThe gridded fields are on the standard 65 x 65 NMC polar stereographic grid oriented 80W (grid increment 381 km at 60N), and 100E (grid increment 381 km at 60S); Pole at (33,33). The NMC uses 18 standard pressure levels for data at 1000, 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.4 millibars. Height and temperature data are produced at all 18 pressure levels from 1000 mb to 0.4 mb. Moisture data are only produced in the northern hemisphere for the 6 lowest altitude pressure levels. Wind data are produced for the 12 lowest altitude levels in the northern hemisphere, and at the 4 levels 1000, 500, 300, and 250 mb in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThere are four data files representing each subtype per day. Included in the NMC correlative data set will be a geographical data richness file. This file is used by the NMC access routines, and indicates the radiosonde coverage for each point on the NMC grid.

For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.\n\n",

Note: vertical velocity (omega) data are available from 26 August 1992 forward.\n\nThe numerical Unified Model used in the assimilation system is a global primitive equation model, with a split-explicit time integration scheme. It incorporates a comprehensive range of physical parameterization schemes. It uses a hybrid vertical coordinate system, with terrain-following model levels at low levels, gradually changing to pressure levels in the stratosphere. The input to the assimilation system are from the World Weather Watch network of surface and upper air observations and satellite data.\n\nThe UKMO correlative product consists of a single granule per day containing all the geophysical parameters. Data coverage is global for where the horizontal resolution is 2.5 degrees latitude by 3.75 degrees longitude, using a staggered grid system. For parameters other than wind components, each horizontal field consists of 73 rows of 96 points, starting at 90N, 0E. The wind data are staggered by half a grid, starting at 88.75N, 1.875E (with 72 rows).\n\nThe UKMO correlative assimilation data are on the UARS standard pressure levels (in mbars) given by:\n\nP(i) = 1000 * 10**(-i/6)  for i = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nThe data files are available in a binary record oriented format.",

Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 0.25 degree 3-hourly dataset. \n\nThe 3-hourly data product was simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.

The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). \n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

It is produced at the NASA GES DISC, as a value added product.  Simple summation of valid retrievals in a grid cell is applied for the data day. The result is given in (mm). Although the grid is from 60S to 60N, the high latitudes (beyond 50S/N) near real-time retrievals are considered very unreliable and thus are screened out from the daily accumulations. The beginning and ending time for every daily granule are listed in the file global attributes, and are taken correspondingly from the first and the last 3-hourly granules participating in the aggregation. Thus the time period covered by one daily granule amounts to 24 hours, which can be inspected in the file global attributes.  \n\nCounts of valid retrievals for the day are provided for every variable, making it possible to compute conditional and unconditional mean precipitation for grid cells where less than 8 retrievals for the day are available.\n\nEfforts have been made to make the format of this  derived product as similar as possible to the new Global Precipitation Measurement CF-compliant file format. \n\nThe latency of this derived daily product is about 7 hours after the UTC day is closed. Users should be mindful that the price for the short latency of these data is the reduced quality as compared to the research quality product.\n\nThe information provided here on the TRMM mission, and on the original 3-hr 3B42 product, remain relevant for this derived product. Note, however, this product is in netCDF-4 format.\n\n\n\nThe following describes the derivation in more details.\n\nThe daily accumulation is derived by summing *valid* retrievals in a grid cell for the data day. Since the 3-hourly source data are in mm/hr, a factor of 3 is applied to the sum. Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily     = 3 * SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}, i=[1,Nf]\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nwhere:\nPdaily          - Daily accumulation (mm)\nPi              - 3-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of 3-hourly files per day, Nf=8\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\n\nOn occasion, the 3-hourly source data have fill values for Pi in a very few grid cells. The total accumulation for such grid cells is still issued, inspite of the likelihood that thus resulting accumulation has a larger uncertainty in representing the \"true\" daily total. These events are easily detectable using \"counts\" variables that contain Pdaily_cnt, whereby users can screen out any grid cells for which\n Pdaily_cnt less than Nf.\n\n\nThere are various ways the accumulated daily error could be estimated from the source 3-hourly error. In this release, the daily error provided in the data files is calculated as follows. First, squared 3-hourly errors are summed, and then square root of the sum is taken. Similarly to the precipitation, a factor of 3 is finally applied:\n\nPerr_daily = 3 * { SUM[ (Perr_i * 1[Perr_i valid])^2 ] }^0.5 , i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily accumulated error power, (mm)\nNcnt_err\t- The counts for the error variable\n\nThus computed Perr_daily represents the worst case scenario that assumes the error in the 3-hourly source data, which is given in mm/hr, is accumulating within the 3-hourly period of the source data and then during the day. These values, however, can easily be conveted to root mean square error estimate of the rainfall rate:\n\nrms_err =   { (Perr_daily/3) ^2 / Ncnt_err }^0.5\t(mm/hr)\n\n\nThis estimate assumes that the error given in the 3-hourly files is representative of the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) within the 3-hour window of the files, and it is random throughout the day. Note, this should be interpreted as the error of the rainfall rate (mm/hr) for the day, not the daily accumulation.\n\n\n\n",

Hence, the gap-filled MOD16A2GF is the improved MOD16, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from 8-day Leaf Area Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/FPAR) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation. However, users cannot get MOD16A2GF in near-real time because it will be generated only at the end of a given year.\n\nProvided in the MOD16A2GF product are layers for composited ET, LE, Potential ET (PET), and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer.

    "title": "GLDAS Catchment Land Surface Model L4 3 hourly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V2.0 (GLDAS_CLSM10_3H) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data set, GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree 3-hourly, contains a series of land surface variables simulated from the Catchment Land Surface Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO’s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

    "title": "NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V2.0 (NLDAS_FORA0125_H) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This data set contains the primary forcing hourly data \"File A\" for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2).  The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly.  The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB data files).\n\nThe non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).  NARR analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.  Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between the NARR and NLDAS fields of terrain height.  This vertical adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.  The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).\n\nThe surface downward shortwave radiation field in \"File A\" is a bias-corrected field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave radiation.  This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in \"File A\" is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).\n\nThe precipitation field in \"File A\" is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology.  The precipitation is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order).  The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.  The field in \"File A\" that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in \"File B\"): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from NARR.\n\nThe hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two files, \"File A\" and \"File B\". \"File A\" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven meteorological forcing fields. Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2.0 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). \n",

    "title": "NCEP/CPC L3 Half Hourly 4km Global (60S - 60N) Merged IR V1 (GPM_MERGIR) at GES DISC",
    "description": "These data originate from NOAA/NCEP.\n\nThe NOAA Climate Prediction Center/NCEP/NWS is making the data available originally in binary format, in a weekly rotating archive. The NASA GES DISC is acquiring the binary files as they become available, converts them into CF (Climate and Forecast) -convention compliant netCDF-4 format, and stores the product in a permanent archive. It has been the intention to extend the record back to TRMM epoch, and some data are available from 1998. However, currently, the continuous record starts from February, 2000.\n\nThe leading edge of data availability is delayed by about 24 hours from real-time to abide by international data exchange agreements between NOAA and EUMETSAT (the METEOSAT data providers).\n\nThe data contain  globally-merged (60S-60N) 4-km pixel-resolution IR brightness temperature data (equivalent blackbody temps), merged from the European, Japanese, and U.S. geostationary satellites over the period of record (GOES-8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16, METEOSAT-5/7/8/9/10, and GMS-5/MTSat-1R/2/Himawari-8).\n\nThe data have been corrected for \"zenith angle dependence\", i.e. IR temperatures for locations far from satellite nadir are erroneously cold due to a combination of geometric effects and radiometric path extinction effects.  This correction allows for the merging of the IR data from the various geostationary satellites with greatly reduced discontinuities at their boundaries.  Some residual differences among the data exist since the IR channels aboard the various spacecraft have slightly different characteristics and no intercalibration among the sensors has been performed. NOAA are in the process of performing such an intercalibration, although this effect is considerably smaller than the zenith angle effects. As well, parallax correction is applied, which shifts the geo-location of the GEO-IR footprints to approximately account for the cloud tops being displaced away from their actual geographic location when viewed along a slanted path.\n\n\nThe NASA GES DISC is curating these data in a self-documenting, CF-compliant, netCDF-4 format, which allows a broad range of applications to access the data directly, without the need to cope with the original binary data format. In addition to the direct download of netCDF-4 data, the GES DISC provides data download in binary, ASCII, and netCDF-3 formats using the OPeNDAP interface. \n\n\nSimilarities with the original\n-----------------------------\nAs in the original binaries, every netCDF-4 file covers one hour, and contains two half-hourly grids, at 4-km grid cell resolution. \n\n\nDifferences from the original\n-----------------------------\n1. The data in the netCDF-4 files are already converted to real (float) values of Brightness Temperatures in Kelvin. There is no need to further scale these data. The netCDF-4 format is machine-independent and users need not worry about the endian-ness of their machines. \n\n2. To meet the requirements of collection spatial metadata, the grid is re-ordered from the original and now goes from -180 (West) to 180 (East). It is also starting from -60 (South).\n\nThe data and time units are reflected in the corresponding \"units\" attributes, and grid dimensions are described by longitude (\"lon\"), latitude (\"lat\") and \"time\" vectors. Thus, any CF-compliant tool should automatically understand the setup in the data files and the starting time for each half-hourly grid. Even without such tools, simple \"ncdump\" or \"h5dump\" command line tools will easily disclose the netCDF-4 files configuration.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n------------------\nThe creation of the original data at NOAA/NCEP is supported by funding from the NOAA Office of Global Programs for the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and by NASA via the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). \n\nThe permanent archive at GES DISC is supported by NASA's HQ Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program. \n\n\n",

    "title": "Gridded 6 hours Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_CONV_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose OMAervation, background and analysis errors at OMAervation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate OMAervation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the OMAerving system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, OMAervation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the OMAerving system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an OMAervation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of OMAervation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given OMAervation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded OMAervation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. \n\nDetails about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Noah LSM can be found in Xia et al. (2012). \n\nThe Noah model was developed as the land component of the NOAA NCEP mesoscale Eta model [Betts et al. (1997); Chen et al. (1997); Ek et al. (2003)].  As used in NLDAS-2, recent modifications were made to Noah's cold-season [Livneh et al. (2010)] and warm-season [Wei et al. (2012)] parameterizations.  Noah serves as the land component in the evolving Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional atmospheric model, the NOAA NCEP coupled Climate Forecast System (CFS), and the Global Forecast System (GFS).  The model simulates the soil freeze-thaw process and its impact on soil heating/cooling and transpiration, following Koren et al. (1999).  The model has four soil layers with spatially invariant thicknesses of 10, 30, 60, and 100 cm.

    "description": "Version 7.3 is the current version of the data set. Version 3.5 is no longer available and has been superseded by Version 7.3.\n\nThis data set is currently provided by the OCO (Orbiting Carbon Observatory) Project. In expectation of the OCO-2 launch, the algorithm was developed by the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) Task as a preparatory project, using GOSAT TANSO-FTS spectra. After the OCO-2 launch,  \"ACOS\" data are still produced and improved, using approaches applied to the OCO-2 spectra.\n\nThe \"ACOS\" data set contains Carbon Dioxide (CO2) column averaged dry air mole fraction for all soundings for which retrieval was attempted. These are the highest-level products made available by the OCO Project, using TANSO-FTS spectral radiances, and algorithm build version 7.3.\n\nThe GOSAT team at JAXA produces GOSAT TANSO-FTS Level 1B (L1B) data products for internal use and for distribution to collaborative partners, such as ESA and NASA. These calibrated products are augmented by the OCO Project with additional geolocation information and further corrections. Thus produced Level 1B products (with calibrated radiances and geolocation) are the input to the \"ACOS\" Level 2 production process.\n\nEven though the GES DISC is not publicly distributing Level 1B ACOS products, it should be known that changes in this version are affecting both Level 1B and Level 2 data. An important enhancement in Level1B will address the degradation in the number of quality-passed soundings. \n\nElimination of many systematic biases, and better agreement with TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network), is expected in Level 2 retrievals. The key changes to the L2 algorithm include scaling the O2-A band spectroscopy (reducing XCO2 bias by 4 or 5 ppm); using interpolation with the instrument lineshape [ ILS ] (reducing XCO2 bias by 1.5 ppm); and fitting a zero level offset to the A-band. Users have to also carefully familiarize themselves with the disclaimer in the new documentation. \n\nAn important element to note are the updates on data screening. Although a Master Quality Flag is provided in the data product, further analysis of a larger set of data has allowed the science team to provide an updated set of screening criteria. These are listed in the data user's guide, and are recommended instead of the Master Quality Flag.\n\n\nLastly, users should continue to carefully observe and weigh information from three important flags:\n \n      \"warn_level\" - Provides a value that summarizes each sounding's acceptability to a larger set of quality filters. A high warn level predicts that the sounding would fail most data filters applied to it. A low warn level suggests that the sounding would pass most quality filters that might be applied. \n\n      \"sounding_qual_flag\" - quality of input data provided to the retrieval processing    \n\n      \"outcome_flag\" - retrieval quality based upon certain internal thresholds (not thoroughly evaluated)    \n\n      \"master_quality_flag\" - four possible values: \"Good\", \"Caution\" and \"Bad\", and \"Failed\", as determined from other flags in the L2 productThe short name for this data type is ACOS_L2S.",

In NLDAS, Mosaic is configured to support a maximum of 10 tiles per grid cell with a 5% cutoff that ignores vegetation classes covering less than 5% of the cell. Additionally in NLDAS, all tiles of Mosaic in a grid cell have a predominant soil type and three soil layers with fixed thickness values of 10, 30, and 160 cm (hence constant rooting depth of 40 cm and constant total column depth of 200 cm). \n\nDetails about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Mosaic LSM can be found in Xia et al.

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency.  NLDAS-2 is providing a second forcing file, \"File B\", in which the surface temperature, humidity, and wind fields are represented not at 2-meters and 10-meters above the height of the NLDAS terrain, but rather at the same height above the NLDAS terrain as the height above the NARR terrain of the lowest prognostic level of the NARR assimilation system (namely, the same height above the model terrain as the lowest prognostic level of the mesoscale Eta model, which is the assimilating model in NARR). \n\nThe surface downward surface radiation field in \"File B\" is taken directly from NARR, without any bias correction.  The precipitation and convective precipitation fields in \"File B\" are also taken directly from NARR, and are used to calculate the convective fraction provided in \"File A\".

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products. \n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.\n\nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

    "description": "This is the wide-swath MODIS/Aqua subset along CloudSat field of view track. The goal of the wide-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-100 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 200 km cross-track. However, the original MYD05_L2 has data of 5- and 1-km pixels. Thus, MAC05S1 cross-track width is 41- and 201-pixels, depending on the parameter. Along-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.\n      \nIn the standard product, the MODIS level-2 atmospheric precipitable water product consists of total atmospheric column water vapor amounts (and ancillary parameters) over clear land areas of the globe, over extended clear oceanic areas with the Sun glint, and above clouds over both land and ocean. These estimates are based on a near-infrared algorithm using only daytime measurements with solar zenith angle less than 72 degrees. The retrieval algorithm relies on observations of water vapor attenuation of near-infrared solar radiation reflected by surfaces and clouds. The product is produced only over areas that have reflective surfaces in the near-infrared. The infrared-derived precipitable water vapor generated for both daytime &amp; nighttime conditions as one component of another MODIS product (MYD07) is also provided as a part of this product. \n      \n      \n(The shortname for this product is MAC05S1).",

The AIRS Only Level 3 Monthly Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.

    "description": "The MOD16A3GF Version 6.1 Evapotranspiration/Latent Heat Flux (ET/LE) product is a year-end gap-filled yearly composite dataset produced at 500 meter (m) pixel resolution. The algorithm used for the MOD16 data product collection is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover.\n\nThe MOD16A3GF will be generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MOD15A2H (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD15A2H.061) is available. Hence, the gap-filled MOD16A3GF is the improved MOD16, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from yearly Leaf Area Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/FPAR) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation. However, users cannot get MOD16A3GF in near-real time because it will be generated only at the end of a given year.\n\nProvided in the MOD16A3GF product are layers for composited ET, LE, Potential ET (PET), and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer. Two low resolution browse images, ET and LE, are also available for each MOD16A3GF granule.\n\nThe pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET) are the sum for all days within the defined year, and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all days within the defined year.\n\nValidation at stage 1 (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/newPage.cgi?fileName=maturity) has been achieved for MODIS Evapotranspiration products.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The product uses Climatology LAI/FPAR as back up to the operational LAI/FPAR. \n\n",

This product is designed to take advantage of the synergy between OMI and MODIS, which both fly on satellites in the NASA A-Train constellation of Earth-observing satellites that follow similar orbital tracks and collect near-simultaneous observations. This product can be used for cloud-clearing, detection of multi-layered clouds, and other applications that may exploit these multi-spectral measurements.\n\nThe algorithm for the OMMYDCLD product co-locates daytime cloud parameters from MODIS onto the OMI visible (VIS) pixel for a given OMI orbit and generates statistical information from the collocated MODIS pixels. For each OMI granule, the orbit start and end times are used to select the corresponding 5-minute MODIS granules for processing. A contiguous list of MODIS granules spanning the full duration of the OMI orbit are selected based on the relative time lag between Aqua and Aura. The algorithm lead for this product is NASA OMI scientist Dr. Joanna Joiner.\n\nThe OMMYDCLD data files are stored in the version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5) using the swath model, and follows the same conventions used by the other OMI Level-2 data products. Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (about 53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The file size for the OMMYDCLD data product is about 8 Mbytes.",

The Ka-band results are further divided into the standard and high-sensitivity estimates. In the standard sensitivity mode, the fields of view within the inner swath are matched to those of the Ku-band. Data from these matched-beam Ku- and Ka-band fields of view are used to derive the dual-frequency precipitation products. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar instrument field of view (IFOV).",

ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nECO3ETPTJPL Version 1 is a Level 3 (L3) product that provides evapotranspiration (ET) generated from data acquired by the ECOSTRESS radiometer instrument according to the Priestly-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) algorithm described in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/335/ECO3ETPTJPL_ATBD_V1.pdf). The ET product is generated from the Level 2 data products for surface temperature and emissivity, the Level 1 geolocation information, and a significant number of ancillary data inputs from other sources.  ET is set by various controls, including radiative and atmospheric demand, and environmental sensitivity, productivity, vegetation physiology, and phenology. PT-JPL is best utilized for natural ecosystems. The L3 ET product is used for creating the Level 4 products, Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) and Water Use Efficiency (WUE).\r\n\r\nThe ECO3ETPTJPL Version 1 data product contains layers of instantaneous ET, daily ET, canopy transpiration, soil evaporation, ET uncertainty, and interception evaporation. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.",

GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data product, GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree 3-hourly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 22, 2019.  The data product contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).  The land mask was modified to accommodate the river routing scheme included in the simulations in the fall 2019 update. \n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

    "description": "ML2OH is the EOS Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) standard product for  hydroxyl derived from radiances measured by the THz radiometer. The data version is 5.0. Data coverage is continuous from August 8, 2004 to December 12, 2009 when the THz radiometer was placed in standby mode. After this date OH data were collected for about 30 days in August/September of 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Spatial coverage is near-global (-82 degrees to +82 degrees latitude), with each profile spaced 1.5 degrees or ~165 km along the orbit track (roughly 15 orbits per day). The recommended useful vertical range is from 31.6 to 0.00316 hPa, and the vertical resolution is about 3. Users of the ML2OH data product should read section 3.19 of the EOS MLS Level 2 Version 5 Quality Document for more information.\n\nThe data are stored in the version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5), which is based on the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format, or HDF-5. Each file contains two swath objects (profile and column data), each with a set of data and geolocation fields, swath attributes, and metadata.",

    "title": "GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 0.25 x 0.25 degree V2.0 (GLDAS_NOAH025_M) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2. GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data product, GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree monthly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 19, 2019.  The data product was generated through temporal averaging of the reprocessed 3-hourly data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).  The land mask was modified to accommodate the river routing scheme included in the simulations in the fall 2019 update.  \n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data globally as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe ECO2CLD Version 1 data product provides a cloud mask that can be used to determine cloud cover for the ECO1BRAD, ECO2LSTE, ECO3ETPTJPL, ECO4ESIPTJPL, and ECO4WUE data products. The ECOSTRESS Level 2 cloud product is derived using the five calibrated thermal bands in a multispectral cloud-conservative thresholding approach. The details of the algorithm are provided in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). The corresponding ECO1BGEO (https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO1BGEO.001) data product is required to georeference the ECO2CLD data product.\r\n\r\nThe ECO2CLD Version 1 data product contains a single cloud mask layer. Information on how to interpret the bit fields in the cloud mask is provided in section 3.1 of the User Guide.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gap: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

Older versions have been superseded by Version 3.2.\n\nThe Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) is the precipitation component of an internationally coordinated set of (mainly) satellite-based global products dealing with the Earth's water and energy cycles, under the auspices of the Global Water and Energy Experiment (GEWEX) Data and Assessment Panel (GDAP) of the World Climate Research Program.  As the follow on to the GPCP Version 2.X products, GPCP Version 3 (GPCP V3.2) seeks to continue the long, homogeneous precipitation record using modern merging techniques and input data sets.  The GPCPV3 suite currently consists the 0.5-degree monthly and daily products.  A follow-on 0.1-degree 3-hourly is expected.  All GPCPV3 products will be internally consistent. The monthly product spans 1983 - 2020. Inputs consist of the GPROF SSMI/SSMIS orbit files that are used to calibrate the PERSIANN-CDR IR-based precipitation in the span 60°N-S, which are in turn calibrated to the monthly 2.5-degree METH product.  The METH-GPROF-adjusted PERSIANN-CDR IR estimates are then climatologically adjusted to the blended TCC/MCTG.  Outside of 58°N-S, TOVS/AIRS estimates, adjusted climatologically to the MCTG, are used.  The PERSIANN-CDR / TOVS/AIRS estimates are then merged in the region 35°N-S-58°N-S, which are then merged with GPCC gauge analyses over land to obtain the final product. In addition to the final precipitation field, ancillary precipitation and error estimates are provided.",

Because the vertical information comes from a radiometer, it is not written out in independent vertical layers like the TRMM Precipitation Radar. Instead, the output is referenced to one of 100 typical structures for each hydrometeor or heating profile. These vertical structures are referenced as clusters in the output structure. Vertical hydrometeor profiles can be reconstructed to 28 layers by knowing the cluster number (i.e. shape) of the profile and a scale factor that is written for each pixel.\n\nThis product contains hydrometeor profiles of cloud liquid water, precipitation water, cloud ice water, precipitation ice, rainfall type, and latent heating in 28 atmospheric layers. \n\nChanges in horizontal resolution resulting from the TRMM boost that occurred on 24 August 2001:\n\nPre-Boost (before 7 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 91.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 760 km; Horizontal Resolution: 4.4 km \n\nPost-Boost (after 24 August 2001): Temporal Resolution: 92.5 min/orbit ~ 16 orbits/day; Swath Width: 878 km; Horizontal Resolution: 5.1 km\n",

    "title": "Goddard Satellite-Based Surface Turbulent Fluxes, 1x1 deg Daily Grid, Set1 V2c (GSSTF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "These data are the Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes Version-2c (GSSTF2c) Dataset recently produced through a MEaSUREs funded project led by Dr. Chung-Lin Shie (UMBC/GEST, NASA/GSFC), converted to HDF-EOS5 format. The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. \n\nGSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the \"artifactitious\" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently. \n\nGSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful \"Rice Cooker Theory\" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., \"To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality\" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c. \n\nThis is the Daily (24-hour) product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. \n\nA finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3. \n\nThe GSSTF, Version 2c, daily fluxes have first been produced for each individual available SSM/I satellite tapes (e.g., F08, F10, F11, F13, F14 and F15).

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 8-Day Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers an 8-day period, or one-half of the Aqua orbit repeat cycle. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone.

The goal of the narrow-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-5 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 10 km cross-track. However, the original MYD05_L2 has data of 5- and 1-km pixels. Thus, MAC05S0 cross-track width is 3- and 11-pixels, depending on the parameter, and the resultant swath is about 15- and 10-km, correspondingly. Along-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.\n      \nIn the standard product, the MODIS level-2 atmospheric precipitable water product consists of total atmospheric column water vapor amounts (and ancillary parameters) over clear land areas of the globe, over extended clear oceanic areas with the Sun glint, and above clouds over both land and ocean. These estimates are based on a near-infrared algorithm using only daytime measurements with solar zenith angle less than 72 degrees. The retrieval algorithm relies on observations of water vapor attenuation of near-infrared solar radiation reflected by surfaces and clouds. The product is produced only over areas that have reflective surfaces in the near-infrared. The infrared-derived precipitable water vapor generated for both daytime &amp; nighttime conditions as one component of another MODIS product (MYD07) is also provided as a part of this product. \n      \n      \n(The shortname for this product is MAC05S0).",

We apply TOMS ozone team  calibration techniques and consistent MEaSUREs SO2 (MS_SO2) algorithm, to obtain the best measurement-based ESDR of volcanic and anthropogenic SO2 masses and emissions. \n\nAs part of the NASA's Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program, the Goddard Earth Science (GES) Data and Information Data Center (DISC) has released a new SO2 Earth System Data Record (ESDR), TOMSN7SO2, re-processed using new 4 UV wavelength bands MS_SO2 algorithm that spans the full Nimbus 7 data period. TOMSN7SO2 is a Level 2 orbital swath product, which will be used to study the fifteen-year SO2 record from the Nimbus-7 TOMS and to expand the historical database of known volcanic eruptions.\n\n Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is a short-lived gas primarily produced by volcanoes, power plants, refineries, metal smelting and burning of fossil fuels. Where SO2 remains near the Earth s surface, it is toxic, causes acid rain, and degrades air quality. Where SO2 is lofted into the free troposphere, it forms aerosols that can alter cloud reflectivity and precipitation. In the stratosphere, volcanic SO2 forms sulfate aerosols that can result in climate change.\n",

The latency was about seven hours from the observation time, although processing issues may delay or prevent this schedule. Users should be mindful that the price for the short latency of these data is the reduced quality as compared to the research quality product.\n\nEach file is a snapshot considered to represent the three-hour period centered on the \"nominal\" file time.  So, e.g., 00 UTC nominally represents the period from 2230 UTC of the previous day to 0130 UTC of the current day. Estimates outside the band 50 degree N-S are considered highly experimental. \n\nGES DISC initially receives these data from the Precipitation Processing System (PPS) in binary format.  However, before archiving, the data are scaled to real numbers, and re-arranged to a standard grid so that the first grid cell is at 180W, 60S. Thus formatted, data are stored  into CF-1.6 compliant netCDF-4 files and archived. This format is machine-independent, self-explanatory,  provides extremely efficient seamless compression, and gives various options for previewing the data without downloading it.\n\nApart from these technical differences, all other science content details remain the same, and users are strongly encouraged to read the provider's documentation that is linked to from here.",

The major V4.0 updates include: (1) use of a new daily and OMI ﬁeld of view speciﬁc geometry dependent surface Lambertian Equivalent Reﬂectivity (GLER) product in both NO2 and cloud retrievals; (2) use of improved cloud parameters (eﬀective cloud fraction and cloud optical centroid pressure) from a new cloud algorithm (OMCDO2N) that are retrieved consistently with NO2 using a new algorithm for O2-O2 slant column data and the GLER product for terrain reﬂectivity; (3) use of a more accurate terrain pressure calculated using OMI ground pixel-averaged terrain height and monthly mean GMI terrain pressure; and (4) improved treatment over snow/ice surfaces by using the concept of scene LER and scene pressure. The details can be found in the updated OMNO2 readme document (see Documentation). The OMNO2 product contains slant column NO2 (total amount along the average optical path from the sun into the atmosphere, and then toward the satellite), the total NO2 vertical column density (VCD), the stratospheric and tropospheric VCDs, air mass factors (AMFs), scattering weights for calculation of AMFs, and other ancillary data. The short name for the Level-2 swath type column NO2 products is OMNO2. Other OMNO2-associated NO2 products include the Level-2 gridded column product, OMNO2G, and the Level-3 gridded column product, OMNO2d.\n\nThe OMNO2 files are stored in version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each Level-2 file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The maximum file size for the OMNO2 is ~24 MB.",

    "title": "OMPS/NPP PCA SO2 Total Column 1-Orbit L2 Swath 50x50km V2 (OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 product is part of the MEaSUREs (Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments) suite of products.\n\nIt is retrieved from the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) Nadir Mapper (NM) spectrometer and provides contiguous daily global monitoring of anthropogenic and volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2), an important pollutant and aerosol precursor that affects both air quality and the climate. The product is based on the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center principal component analysis (PCA) spectral fitting algorithm (Li et al., 2013, 2017), and continues (Zhang et al., 2017) NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) standard Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument SO2 product (OMSO2). \n\nThe latest OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V2 product uses new Jacobian lookup tables and more realistic model based a priori profiles in anthropogenic SO2 retrievals. This helps to more accurately account for the pixel-to-pixel variation in SO2 sensitivity due to different factors such as the vertical distribution of SO2, solar and viewing angles, surface reflectivity, and cloudiness. As compared with the previous OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V1.2 product that assumes the same SO2 sensitivity for all OMPS pixels, the new V2 anthropogenic SO2 retrievals have reduced retrieval biases especially over background regions (see Figure 1 for an example). The same updated PCA SO2 retrieval algorithm (Li et al., 2020) is also used to produce the recently released OMSO2 V2 product (doi:10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2022). The new OMPS_NPP_NMSO2_PCA_L2 V2 product thus offers enhanced consistency between the NASA EOS standard (OMI) and continuity (OMPS) SO2 data records\n\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2) is a short-lived gas primarily produced by volcanoes, power plants, refineries, metal smelting and burning of fossil fuels. Where SO2 remains near the Earth's surface, it is toxic, causes acid rain, and degrades air quality. Where SO2 is lofted into the free troposphere, it forms aerosols that can alter cloud reflectivity and precipitation. In the stratosphere, volcanic SO2 forms sulfate aerosols that can result in climate change.",

    "description": "The National Climate Assessment - Land Data Assimilation System, or NCA-LDAS, is a terrestrial water reanalysis in support of the United States Global Change Research Program's NCA activities. NCA-LDAS features high resolution, gridded, daily time series data products of terrestrial water and energy balance stores, states, and fluxes over the continental U.S., derived from land surface hydrologic modeling with multivariate assimilation of satellite Environmental Data Records (EDRs). The overall goal is to provide the highest quality terrestrial hydrology products that enable improved scientific understanding, adaptation, and management of water and related energy resources during a changing climate.\n\nAn overview of NCA-LDAS and its capability for developing climate change indicators are provided in Jasinski et al. (2019).  Details on the data assimilation used in NCA-LDAS are described in Kumar et al. (2019).  Sample mean annual trends are provided in the NCA-LDAS V2.0 README document.\n\nThis NCA-LDAS version 2.0 data product was simulated for the continental United States for the satellite era from January 1979 to December 2016. The core of NCA-LDAS is the multivariate assimilation of past and current satellite based data records within the Noah Version 3.3 land-surface model (LSM) at 1/8th degree resolution using NASA's Land Information System (LIS; Kumar et al. 2006) software framework during the Earth observing satellite era. The temporal resolution is daily. NCA-LDAS V001 data will no longer be available and have been superseded by V2.0.\n\nNCA-LDAS includes 42 variables including land-surface fluxes (e.g. precipitation, radiation and latent and sensible heat, etc.), stores (e.g. soil moisture and snow), states (e.g., surface temperature), and routing variables (e.g., runoff, streamflow, flooded area, etc.), driven by the atmospheric forcing data from North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2; Xia et al., 2012). NCA-LDAS builds upon NLDAS through the addition of multivariate assimilation of earth observations such as soil moisture (Kumar et al, 2014), snow (Liu et al, 2015; Kumar et al, 2015a) and irrigation (Ozdagon et al, 2010; Kumar et al, 2015b). The EDRs that have been assimilated into the NCA-LDAS include soil moisture and snow depth from principally microwave sensors including SMMR, SSM/I, AMSR-E, ASCAT, AMSR-2, SMOS, and SMAP, irrigation intensity estimates from MODIS, and snow covered area from MODIS and from the multisensor IMS snow product.",

The goal of the narrow-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-5 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 10 km cross-track. However, the original MYD06_L2 has data of 5- and 1-km pixels.

Each data file contains a days worth of ozone measurements, and is written in an ASCII text format.\n\nThe SBUV/2 is a scanning double monochromator and a cloud cover radiometer (CCR) designed to measure ultraviolet (UV) spectral intensities. In its primary mode of operation, the monochromator measures solar radiation backscattered by the atmosphere in 12 discrete wavelength bands in the near-UV, ranging from 252.0 to 339.8 nanometers, each with a bandpass of 1.1 nm. The total-ozone algorithm uses the four longest wavelength bands (312.5, 317.5, 331.2 and 339.8 nm), whereas the profiling algorithm uses the shorter wavelengths. The cloud cover radiometer operates at 379 nm (i.e., outside the ozone absorption band) with a 3.0 nm bandpass and was designed to measure the reflectivity of the surface in the IFOV. The SBUV/2 also makes periodic measurements of the solar flux by deploying a diffuser plate into the FOV to reflect sunlight into the measurement.",

GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product, reprocessed in January 2020, is for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream and it is a replacement to its previous version.\n\nThe 3-hourly data product was simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present. The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

DSR is incident solar radiation over land surfaces in the shortwave spectrum (300-4,000 nanometers) and is an important variable in land-surface models that address a variety of scientific and application issues. The MCD18 products are based on a prototyping algorithm that uses multi-temporal signatures of MODIS data to derive surface reflectance and then calculate incident DSR using the look-up table (LUT) approach. The LUTs consider different types of loadings of aerosols and clouds at a variety of illumination/viewing geometry. Global DSR products are generated from MODIS and geostationary satellite data. Additional details regarding the methodology used to create the data are available in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/106/MCD18_ATBD.pdf)).\n\nProvided in the MOD18A1 product are layers for instantaneous DSR array for each individual MODIS overpass and 3-hour DSR array along with a View Zenith Angle layer.\n\nValidation at stage 1 ( https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Surface Radiation products.

Meteorological fields from the WRF model are used to drive STILT. STILT applies a Lagrangian particle dispersion model backwards in time from a measurement location (the \"receptor\" location), to create the adjoint of the transport model in the form of a \"footprint\" field. The footprint, with units of mixing ratio  per surface flux, quantifies the influence of upwind surface fluxes on greenhouse gas concentrations measured at the receptor and is computed by counting the number of particles in a surface-influenced volume and the time spent in that volume. For each column observation location, the receptors are located at 14 discrete vertical levels throughout the atmospheric column.  The CMS program is designed to make significant contributions in characterizing, quantifying, understanding, and predicting the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks through improved monitoring of carbon stocks and fluxes. The System uses NASA observations and modeling/analysis capabilities to establish the accuracy, quantitative uncertainties, and utility of products for supporting national and international policy, regulatory, and management activities.

    "description": "This is the wide-swath MODIS/Aqua subset along CloudSat field of view track. The goal of the wide-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-100 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 200 km cross-track. Geolocations in the original product, however, are subsampled at 5-km, and thus the crosss-track width of the subset geolocations is 41 pixels. The subset Cloud Mask has 201 pixels across-track. However, some of the Cloud Mask information is at bit level, thus allowing storing actually 250-m information in seemingly 1-km pixels. This is achieved by reserving 2 bytes (the last two out of six) of every 1-km pixel as 16 yes/no-cloud bits. Each one of these 16 bits flags a corresponding 250-m tile inside the 1-km pixel. Their state is described in the local attributes to the Cloud_Mask HDF data set, and accordingly must be interprated as 0=YES, 1=NO. Thus the effective cross-track width, for these two bytes only, is 804 tiles of 250-m denomination. \n      \nAlong-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved.\n      \nIn the standard product, the MODIS level-2 cloud mask product is a global product generated for both daytime &amp; nighttime conditions at 1-km spatial resolution (at nadir) and for daytime at 250-m resolution. The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed. An indication of shadows affecting the scene is also provided. The 250-m cloud mask flags are based on the  visible channel data only. Radiometrically accurate radiances are required, so holes in the cloud mask will appear wherever the input radiances are incomplete or of poor quality. The shortname for this Level-2 MODIS cloud mask product is MYD35_L2 and the principal investigator for this product is MODIS scientist Dr. Paul Menzel (paulm@ssec.wisc.edu).\n      \n      \n(The shortname for this product is MAC35S1).",

    "title": "GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGDF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "\nVersion 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) IMERG is a NASA product estimating global surface precipitation rates at a high resolution of 0.1° every half-hour beginning 2000.  It is part of the joint NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, using the GPM Core Observatory satellite as the standard to combine precipitation observations from an international constellation of satellites using advanced techniques.  IMERG can be used for global-scale applications as well as over regions with sparse or no reliable surface observations.  The fine spatial and temporal resolution of IMERG data allows them to be accumulated to the scale of the application for increased skill.  IMERG has three Runs with varying latencies in response to a range of application needs: rapid-response applications (Early Run, 4-h latency), same/next-day applications (Late Run, 14-h latency), and post-real-time research (Final Run, 3.5-month latency).  While IMERG strives for consistency and accuracy, satellite estimates of precipitation are expected to have lower skill over frozen surfaces, complex terrain, and coastal zones.  As well, the changing GPM satellite constellation over time may introduce artifacts that affect studies focusing on multi-year changes.\n\nThis dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Final* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH.  The derived result represents the Final estimate of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day. The dataset is produced by first computing the mean precipitation rate in (mm/hour) in every grid cell, and then multiplying the result by 24.  This minimizes the possible dry bias in versions before \"07\", in the simple daily totals  for cells where less than 48 half-hourly observations are valid for the day. The latter under-sampling is very rare in the combined microwave-infrared and rain gauge  dataset, variable \"precipitation\",  and appears in higher latitudes. Thus, in most cases users of global \"precipitation\" data will not notice any difference. This correction, however, is noticeable in the high-quality microwave retrieval, variable \"MWprecipitation\", where the occurrence of less than 48 valid half-hourly samples per day is very common. The counts of the valid half-hourly samples per day have always been provided as a separate variable, and users of daily data were advised to pay close attention to that variable and use it to calculate the correct precipitation daily rates. Starting with version \"07\", this is done in production to minimize possible misinterpretations of the data. The counts are still provided in the data, but they are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThe latency of the derived *Final* Daily product depends on the delivery of the IMERG *Final* Half-Hourly product GPM_IMERGHH. Since the latter are delivered in a batch, once per month for the entire month, with 2-3 months latency, so will be the latency for the Final Daily, plus about 24 hours. Thus, e.g. the Dailies for January  can be expected to appear no earlier than April 2. \n\n\n\nThe daily mean rate (mm/day) is derived by first computing the mean precipitation rate (mm/hour) in a grid cell for the data day, and then multiplying the result by 24.  Thus, for every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily_mean     = SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]} / Pdaily_cnt  * 24, i=[1,Nf]\n\nWhere:\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nPi              - half-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of half-hourly files per day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt      - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid value.\n\nPdaily_cnt are provided in the data files as variables \"precipitation_cnt\" and \"MWprecipitation_cnt\", for correspondingly the microwave-IR-gauge and microwave-only retrievals. They are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThere are various ways the daily error could be estimated from the source half-hourly random error (variable \"randomError\"). The daily error provided in the data files is calculated in a fashion similar to the daily mean precipitation rate. First, the mean of the squared half-hourly \"randomError\"  for the day is computed, and the resulting (mm^2/hr) is converted to (mm^2/day). Finally, square root is taken to get the result in (mm/day):\n\nPerr_daily = { SUM{ (Perr_i)^2 * 1[Perr_i valid] ) } / Ncnt_err  * 24}^0.5, i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_i\t\t- half-hourly input, \"randomError\", (mm/hr)\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily error, (mm/day)\nNcnt_err\t\t- Number of valid half-hour error estimates\n\nAgain, the sum of squared \"randomError\" can be reconstructed, and other estimates can be derived using the available counts in the Daily files.\n",

    "title": "Aqua/AIRS L3 Daily Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS+AMSU) 1 degree x 1 degree V7.0 at GES DISC",
    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South at 1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North at 1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. The value for each grid box is the sum of the values that fall within the 1x1 area divided by the number of points in the box. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product is for GLDAS-2.1 VIC 3-hourly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.

A supplemental and improved set of land surface hydrological fields (MERRA-Land) was generated by re-running a revised version of the land component of the MERRA system (Reichle et al., 2012). Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.\n\nThe MERRA-Land product, MST1NXMLD or tavg1_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional time averaged single-level at the native resolution.

ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) ECO4ESIALEXI Version 1 data product provides the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), which is computed from clear-sky estimates of the relative daily evapotranspiration (ET) fraction: ESI = ET/ETo, where ET is ETdaily from the ECOSTRESS Level 3 product and ETo is the reference ET. A description of the major components of the ECOSTRESS algorithm implemented in Version 1 of the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) Disaggregation algorithm (DisALEXI) ESI code is provided in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1002/ECO4ESIALEXI_ATBD_V1.pdf).

A low-resolution browse is also available showing daily ESI as a stretched image with a color ramp in JPEG format.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach, only TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are the same as before, but the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other.

Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the individual CO2 retrievals which fall within that grid box over the month. The mid-tropospheric CO2 retrievals have been averaged and binned into 2.5 x 2 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -60.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean.",

Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI SO2 from ultraviolet spectral measurements is the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method. The relevant information of absorption cross section, instrument characteristics, cloud cover, and geolocation are utilized to derive SO2 slant column density (SCD). A sensitive spectral window of 312 to 326 nm is set as the baseline for the slant column fit with another two spectral windows (325 to 335 nm, 360 to 390 nm) to account for the non-linear effects in those high column amount cases. The SCD is then corrected with the empirical offsets to the systematic biases. The air mass factor (AMF) Look-up table has been created with the LIDORT radiative transfer model. The outputs of the DOAS algorithm are SO2 vertical column density (VCD), SCD, AMF, the DOAS-type averaging kernels (AK), and error estimates.",

    "title": "GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 monthly 1.0 x 1.0 degree V2.0 (GLDAS_NOAH10_M) at GES DISC",
    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2. GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data product, GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree monthly, was reprocessed and replaced its previous data product on November 19, 2019.  The data product was generated through temporal averaging of the reprocessed 3-hourly data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model 3.6, and currently covers from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the data becomes available.  The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Noah model uses the Modified IGBP MODIS 20-category vegetation classification and the soil texture based on the Hybrid STATSGO/FAO) datasets. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).  The land mask was modified to accommodate the river routing scheme included in the simulations in the fall 2019 update.  \n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n",

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX3STD. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.

    "description": "This is the narrow-swath MODIS/Aqua subset along CloudSat field of view track. The goal of the narrow-swath subset is to select and return MODIS data that are within +-5 km across the CloudSat track. I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 10 km cross-track. Geolocations in the original product, however, are subsampled at 5-km, and thus the crosss-track width of the subset geolocations is 3 pixels. The subset Cloud Mask has 11 pixels across-track. However, some of the Cloud Mask information is at bit level, thus allowing storing actually 250-m information in seemingly 1-km pixels. This is achieved by reserving 2 bytes (the last two out of six) of every 1-km pixel as 16 yes/no-cloud bits. Each one of these 16 bits flags a corresponding 250-m tile inside the 1-km pixel. Their state is described in the local attributes to the Cloud_Mask HDF data set, and accordingly must be interprated as 0=YES, 1=NO. Thus the effective cross-track width, for these two bytes only, is 44 tiles of 250-m denomination.\n      \nAlong-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved. \n      \nIn the standard product, the MODIS level-2 cloud mask product is a global product generated for both daytime &amp; nighttime conditions at 1-km spatial resolution (at nadir) and for daytime at 250-m resolution. The algorithm employs a series of visible and infrared threshold and consistency tests to specify confidence levels that an unobstructed view of the Earth's surface is observed. An indication of shadows affecting the scene is also provided. The 250-m cloud mask flags are based on the  visible channel data only. Radiometrically accurate radiances are required, so holes in the cloud mask will appear wherever the input radiances are incomplete or of poor quality. The shortname for this Level-2 MODIS cloud mask product is MYD35_L2 and the principal investigator for this product is MODIS scientist Dr. Paul Menzel (paulm@ssec.wisc.edu).\n      \n      \n(The shortname for this product is MAC35S0).",

    "description": "This is the new (GPM-formated) TRMM product. It replaces the old TRMM_2A12\n Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07. \n\nThe \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\nThe 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:\n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)\n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.\n\n",

    "description": "This version has been superseded by Version 3.2 (DOI: 10.5067/MEASURES/GPCP/DATA304).\n\nThe Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) is the precipitation component of an internationally coordinated set of (mainly) satellite-based global products dealing with the Earth's water and energy cycles, under the auspices of the Global Water and Energy Experiment (GEWEX) Data and Assessment Panel (GDAP) of the World Climate Research Program.  As the follow on to the GPCP Version 2.X products, GPCP Version 3 (GPCP V3.1) seeks to continue the long, homogeneous precipitation record using modern merging techniques and input data sets.  The GPCPV3 suite currently consists the 0.5-degree monthly.  Additional products are planned, namely a 0.5° daily product for the entire record from 1983 to the (delayed) present and a 0.1° 3-hourly product from 1998 to the (delayed) present. All GPCPV3 products will be internally consistent.  The monthly product spans 1983 - 2019. Inputs consist of the GPROF SSMI/SSMIS orbit files that are used to calibrate the PERSIANN-CDR IR-based precipitation in the span 60°N-S.  Outside of 58°N-S, TOVS/AIRS estimates, calibrated by the IR estimates and the GPCC gauge analyses are used.  This satellite-only estimate is then merged with GPCC gauge analyses over land to compute the final product. In addition to the final precipitation field, ancillary precipitation and error estimates are provided.",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream). Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency. Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive. \n\nThis data product is for GLDAS-2.1 VIC monthly 1.0 degree data from the main production stream. It was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.  The GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format. The GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask. Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values. The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README. The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

The surface reference technique rests on the assumption that the difference between the measurements of the normalized surface cross section outside and within the rain provides an estimate of the PIA. The secondary purpose of 2A21 is to compute the normalized radar cross sections (\"sigma-not\" or Normalized Radar Cross-Sectin (NRTS)) of the surface under rain-free conditions. \n\nMain objectives of 2A23 are as follows:\n(a) Detection of bright band (BB) and determination of the height of BB, the\nstrength of BB, and the width (i.e. thickness) of BB when BB exists.\n(b) Classification of rain type into the following three categories:\n- stratiform,\n - convective,\n - other,\nwhere \"other\" means (ice) cloud only and/or maybe noise.\n (c) Detection of shallow isolated and shallow non-isolated.\n (d) Output of Rain/No-rain flag.\n (e) Computation of the estimated height of freezing level.\n (f) Output of the height of storm top. \n\nThe objectives of 2A25 are to correct for the rain attenuation in measured radar reflectivity (Zm) and to estimate the instantaneous three-dimensional distribution of rain from the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) data. The estimated vertical profiles of attenuation-corrected radar reflectivity factor (Ze) and rainfall rate (R) are given at each resolution cell of the PR.

    "description": "The MYD16A3GF Version 6.1 Evapotranspiration/Latent Heat Flux (ET/LE) product is a year-end gap-filled yearly composite dataset produced at 500 meter (m) pixel resolution. The improved algorithm is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover.\n\nThe MYD16A3GF will be generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MYD15A2H (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD15A2H.061) is available. Hence, the gap-filled MYD16A3GF is the improved MYD16, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from 8-day Leaf Area Index and Fraction Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/FPAR) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation. However, users cannot get MYD16A3GF in near-real time because it will be generated only at the end of a given year.\n\nProvided in the MYD16A3GF product are layers for composited ET, LE, Potential ET (PET), and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer. Two low resolution browse images, ET and LE, are also available for each MYD16A3GF granule.\n\nThe pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET) are the sum for all days within the defined year, and the pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all days within the defined year.\n\nValidation at stage 1 (https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/newPage.cgi?fileName=maturity) has been achieved for MODIS Evapotranspiration products.\n\nImprovements/Changes from Previous Changes\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n* A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n* The product uses Climatology LAI/FPAR as back up to the operational LAI/FPAR.\n",

This level-2 global total column ozone product (OMTO3) is based on the enhanced TOMS version-8 algorithm that essentially uses the ultraviolet radiance data at 317.5 and 331.2 nm. OMI hyper-spectral measurements help in the corrections for the factors that induce uncertainty in ozone retrievals (e.g., cloud and aerosol, sea-glint effects, profile shape sensitivity, SO2 and other trace gas contamination). In addition to the total ozone values this product also contains some auxiliary derived and ancillary input parameters including N-values, effective Lambertian scene-reflectivity, UV aerosol index, SO2 index, cloud fraction, cloud pressure, ozone below clouds, terrain height, geolocation, solar and satellite viewing angles, and quality flags. The shortname for this Level-2 OMI total column ozone product is OMTO3. The algorithm lead for this product is NASA OMI scientist  Dr. Pawan K. Bhartia.\n\nThe OMTO3 files are stored in the version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes).

Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nThe TROPOMI UV Aerosol Index has been calculated based on wavelength dependent changes in Rayleigh scattering in the UV spectral range where ozone absorption is weak. A residual value is calculated from measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and per-calculated theoretical reflectance for a Rayleigh scattering-only atmosphere given a wavelength pair.

In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.\n\nFundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).\n\nThe algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.\n\n",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: \n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) \n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. \n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) ECO3ETALEXI Version 1 data product provides estimates of daily evapotranspiration (ET) using the ECOSTRESS Level 2 (L2) land surface temperature and emissivity (LST&amp;E) product, along with ancillary meteorological data and remotely sensed vegetation cover information. The ECO3ETALEXI data product is derived using a physics-based surface energy balance (SEB) algorithm, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) Disaggregation algorithm (DisALEXI). Described in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1000/ECO3ETALEXI_ATBD_V1.pdf), DisALEXI is based on spatial disaggregation of regional-scale fluxes from the ALEXI SEB model. There are many approaches for spatially mapping ET; however, SEB methods are favored for remote sensing retrievals based on land-surface temperature. ALEXI was initially developed for managed landscapes and has now been evaluated in comparison with micrometeorological flux tower observations over crop, forest, grassland, wetland, and semiarid desert sites. Applications include crop water use, crop phenology monitoring, and drought early warning or water stress detection. ECO3ETALEXI is available for CONUS at 70-meter (m) pixel resolution.\r\n\r\nThe ECO3ETALEXI Version 1 data product contains layers of daily ET, ET uncertainty, and associated quality flags. A low-resolution browse is also available showing daily ET as a stretched image with a color ramp in JPEG format.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly, temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented, and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach, only TIR bands 2, 4, and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are the same as before, but the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.",

The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. The file format is netCDF (converted from the GRIB data files). \n\nThe NLDAS-2 monthly primary forcing data were generated from the NLDAS-2 hourly primary forcing data, as monthly accumulation for total precipitation, convective precipitation, and potential evaporation, and monthly average for other variables. The convective precipitation monthly total is the hourly convective fraction multiplied by the hourly precipitation (both from the NLDAS-2 \"File A\" files), and then summed over all hours of the month. Monthly period of each month is from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month. The one exception to this is the first month (Jan. 1979) that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979, except for the monthly accumulated  precipitation and convective precipitation that both start from 12Z 01 Jan 1979. \n\nThe monthly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two files, \"File A\" and \"File B\".  \"File A\" is the primary (default) forcing file and contains eleven meteorological forcing fields.

    "description": "Version 10r is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and are superseded by Version 10r.\n\nIn early 2021, the OCO Team identified an issue with OCO-2 level 2 products processed since January 28, 2020. The Ancillary Geometric Product (AGAP) file, a static file used in OCO-2 Geolocation processing, was inadvertently replaced with an obsolete version. This AGAP file included a ~300 m pointing error. As a result, all OCO-2 Level 2, version 10r, data files for the period January 28 - December 31, 2020, were corrected and replaced. The replacement process was completed by the end of June, 2021. The significance of this error has been described in Kiel et al. (2019; doi:10.5194/amt-12-2241-2019).\n\nThe Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere. The OCO-2 project uses the LEOStar-2 spacecraft that carries a single instrument. It incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers. The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently. Their raw data numbers (DN) are delivered correlated in time to the Level 1B process as Level 1A products. Each band has 1016 spectral elements, although some are masked out in the L2 retrieval.This product is the output from the Level 1B process. It converts the raw instrument data numbers into calibrated radiances. This conversion is based upon files of instrument characteristics and algorithm parameters that may vary over time. In addition to calibrated radiances, the Level 1B output products have geolocation information recorded for each measurement for use in higher-level processes.\n\nThis is the retrospective processing where the calibration data is estimated from the full timeseries of data (before, during, and after the measurements), and is expected to be of slightly higher quality.",

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMND) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-12 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThese Level 3 monthly mean products in the netCDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.

    "description": "Starting from August 6th in 2019, Sentinel-5P TROPOMI along-track high spatial resolution (~5.5km at nadir) has been implemented.\nFor data before August 6th of 2019, please check S5P_L2__CH4____1 data collection.\n\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P or S5P) satellite mission is one of the European Space Agency's (ESA) new mission family - Sentinels, and it is a joint initiative between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the ESA. The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI methane product is a physics based method that uses the Oxygen-A band (760 nm) and absorption bands in shortwave infrared spectrum. In Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI methane algorithm, the atmosphere forward model simulates the absorbing gas (oxygen, methane, water vapor, and carbon monoxide) optical properties, as well as aerosol optical properties with size distribution, refractive index, and number concentration. The inversion is performed based on the forward calculation, the measurement, and the prior information. Cloud filtering is critical in methane retrieval, S5P methane algorithm applies re-gridded Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) cloud mask data. Additional cloud filters based on S5P/TROPOMI measurements and the FRESCO apparent surface pressure will be applied when VIIRS cloud data are not available. Other current data filters in the retrieval algorithm include land-only pixels (excluding mountainous areas), spectrum intensity, solar zenith angle and instrument zenith angle. \n\nThe S5P/TROPOMI methane retrieval is for non-time-critical (NTC) data stream only, and its main outputs include the column averaged dry air mixing ratio of methane, the random error, and the biased corrected dry air methane fraction data based on the retrieved surface albedo. \n\nStarting from orbit #12432 on March 7th of 2020, the S-NPP auxiliary cloud data source used in the methane product data processing has been transitioned from the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM) into the Enterprise Cloud Mask (ECM).\n\nThe data are stored in an enhanced netCDF-4 format.",

    "description": "Version 6 is the current version of this dataset. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 6.\n\nThe Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.\n\nFundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).\n\nThe algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.  \n\n",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX2SUP. It is a new product produced using AIRS IR only because the radiometric noise in AMSU channel 4 started to increase significantly (since June 2007). The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product, plus intermediate outputs (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

    "description": "The mass concentration ammonia in the atmosphere, consists of products generated for the study of atmospheric ammonia. Atmospheric ammonia is an important component of the global nitrogen cycle. In the troposphere, ammonia reacts rapidly with acids such as sulfuric and nitric to form fine particulate matter. These ammonium containing aerosols affect Earth's radiative balance, both directly by scattering incoming radiation and indirectly as cloud condensation nuclei. Major sources of atmospheric ammonia involve agricultural activities including animal husbandry, especially concentrated animal feeding operations and fertilizer use. Major sinks of atmospheric ammonia involve dry deposition and wet removal by precipitation, as well as conversion to particulate ammonium by reaction with acids. Measurements of ambient NH3 are sparse, but satellites provide a means to monitor atmospheric composition globally. Using the AIRS/AMSU satellite this algorithm provides monthly measurements of derived atmospheric NH3 for September 2002 through August 2016.",

Each data file is yearly by variable with 12 monthly time steps and covers the same period of record as the Daymet V4 R1 daily data. The monthly climatology files are derived from the larger datasets of daily weather parameters produced on a 1 km x 1 km grid for North America, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Separate monthly files are provided for the land areas of continental North America (Canada, the United States, and Mexico), Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Data are distributed in standardized Climate and Forecast (CF)-compliant netCDF (*.nc) and Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (*.tif) formats. In Version 4 R1 (ver 4.4), all 2020 and 2021 files (60 total) were updated to improve predictions especially in high-latitude areas. It was found that input files used for deriving 2020 and 2021 data had, for a significant portion of Canadian weather stations, missing daily variable readings for the month of January. NCEI has corrected issues with the Environment Canada ingest feed which led to the missing readings. The revised 2020 and 2021 Daymet V4 R1 files were derived with new GHCNd inputs.

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_SSMI_DMSP10_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder).

    "description": "\nWARNING: On 2021/09/23 the EOS Aqua executed a Deep Space Maneuver (DSM). In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.\n\nThe thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the “spectral_freq” parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts. Approximately 1803 channels have BT shifts of less than 0.1 K and 575 channels are now shifted in BT by more than 0.1 K, while 231 of these channels have BT shifts greater than 0.2 K.\n\nUsers of the L1b v5 product who are concerned that these shifts may impact their science investigations and applications are encouraged to switch to the AIRS L1c v6.7.4 product, which, among many other improvements, converts the spectra to a fixed frequency grid.         END OF WARNING.\n\n\n\nThe AIRS Level 1B Near Real Time (NRT) product (AIRIBRAD_NRT_005) differs from the routine product (AIRIBRAD_005) in 2 ways to meet the three hour latency requirements of the Land Atmosphere NRT Capability Earth Observing System (LANCE): (1) The NRT granules are produced without previous or subsequent granules if those granules are not available within 5 minutes, (2) the predictive ephemeris/attitude data are used rather than the definitive ephemeris/attitude.

Specifically, the MERRA-Land estimates benefit from corrections to the precipitation forcing with the global gauge-based NOAA Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) precipitation product and from revised parameter values in the rainfall interception model, changes that effectively correct for known limitations in the MERRA surface meteorological forcings. With a few exceptions, the MERRA-Land data appear more accurate than the original MERRA estimates and are thus recommended for those interested in using MERRA output for land surface hydrological studies.\n\nThe MERRA-Land product, MSTUNXMLD or tavgU_2d_mld_Nx, is a simulated 2-Dimensional diurnal at the native resolution.

    "description": "The CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and AMSU (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit). The AIRS instrument is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS in combination with the AMSU constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the comprehensive quality control (QC) methodology. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables.\n\nWARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 48.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/48.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files.

    "title": "TOVS GLA MONTHLY GRIDS from NOAA-10 02 (TOVSAMNG) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMNG) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-10 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThese Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format. Each data set is representative of a different monthly average time period and for one of nine satellites. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

Older versions will no longer be available and are superseded by Version 10r.\n\nThe Orbiting Carbon Observatory -3 (OCO-3) was deployed to the International Space Station in May, 2019. It is technically a single instrument, almost identical to OCO-2.\n\nThe Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere.\n\nOCO-3 incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO2 near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O2) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers. The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently. \n\nOxygen-A Band cloud screening algorithm is one of the primary cloud screening tools implemented in the operational OCO processing pipeline. The algorithm was introduced and applied to early GOSAT data  with further analysis performed on OCO-2 simulations.\n\nThe OCO ABO2 algorithm employs a fast Bayesian retrieval to estimate surface pressure and surface albedo from high resolution spectra of the molecular oxygen (O2) A-band, near 0.765 µm. The radiative transfer forward model (FM) assumes a clear-sky condition, i.e. Rayleigh scattering only, such that differences between the modeled and measured radiances are apparent when the measurement scene contains cloud or aerosol. \n\n",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AMSUB_NOAA16_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently. Their raw data numbers (DN) are delivered correlated in time to the Level 1B process as Level 1A products. Each band has 1016 spectral elements, although some are masked out in the L2 retrieval.This product is the output from the Level 1B process. It converts the raw instrument data numbers into calibrated radiances. This conversion is based upon files of instrument characteristics and algorithm parameters that may vary over time. In addition to calibrated radiances, the Level 1B output products have geolocation information recorded for each measurement for use in higher-level processes.\n\nThis is the retrospective processing where the calibration data is estimated from the full timeseries of data (before, during, and after the measurements), and is expected to be of slightly higher quality.",

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSADNG) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-10 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods include daily, 5 day (pentad) and monthly, with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AIRS_AQUA_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nCopernicus Sentinel-5P TROPOMI aerosol layer height algorithm applies a forward model, which includes DISAMAR (Determining Instrument Specifications and Analyzing Methods for Atmospheric Retrieval, a Layer-Based Orders of Scattering algorithm) to calculate monochromatic reflectance, and also employs a neural network scheme for speedy processor performance. Data retrieval uses the Optimal Estimation Method (OEM) for spectral fitting with various aerosol layer pressures and aerosol optical thicknesses in the Oxygen-A band (758 -770nm). The aerosol baseline model assumes a single uniformly distributed aerosol layer with a fixed pressure thickness and a constant aerosol volume extinction coefficient and single scattering albedo. The aerosol parameterization is particularly suitable for elevated non-scattering aerosols such as volcanic ash, desert dust and biomass burning plume. The product main outputs include the mid-pressure and mid-altitude of aerosol layers, aerosol optical thickness at 760nm, error estimates, and other relevant diagnostics.\n\nStarting from orbit #12432 on March 7th of 2020, the S-NPP auxiliary cloud data source used in the aerosol layer height product data processing has been transitioned from the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM) into the Enterprise Cloud Mask (ECM).",

The NRT data are typically available within 3 hours of observation and are broken into files containing about 15 minutes of data. The most recent 7 days of data are available online. Spatial coverage is near-global (-82 degrees to +82 degrees latitude), with each profile spaced 1.5 degrees or ~165 km along the orbit track (roughly 15 orbits per day). The vertical coverage is from 215 to 0.1 hPa.\n\nThe MLS NRT algorithm uses a simplified fast forward model to meet Near Real Time data latency requirements and are therefore not as accurate as the retrievals that constitute the standard MLS products. Nevertheless the results are scientifically useful in selected regions of the Earth's atmosphere provided that the data are screened according to the recommendations in the MLS NRT User Guide and the MLS L2 Data Quality Document for Standard Products.",

    "description": "Version 9r is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and are superseded by Version 9r.\n\nThis data set is currently provided by the OCO (Orbiting Carbon Observatory) Project. In expectation of the OCO-2 launch, the algorithm was developed by the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) Task as a preparatory project, using GOSAT TANSO-FTS spectra. After the OCO-2 launch,  \"ACOS\" data are still produced and improved, using approaches applied to the OCO-2 spectra.\n\nThe \"ACOS\" data set contains Carbon Dioxide (CO2) column averaged dry air mole fraction for all soundings for which retrieval was attempted. These are the highest-level products made available by the OCO Project, using TANSO-FTS spectral radiances, and algorithm build version 7.3.\n\nThe GOSAT team at JAXA produces GOSAT TANSO-FTS Level 1B (L1B) data products for internal use and for distribution to collaborative partners, such as ESA and NASA. These calibrated products are augmented by the OCO Project with additional geolocation information and further corrections. Thus produced Level 1B products (with calibrated radiances and geolocation) are the input to the \"ACOS\" Level 2 production process.\n\nEven though the GES DISC is not publicly distributing Level 1B ACOS products, it should be known that changes in this version are affecting both Level 1B and Level 2 data. An important enhancement in Level1B will address the degradation in the number of quality-passed soundings. \n\nElimination of many systematic biases, and better agreement with TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network), is expected in Level 2 retrievals. The key changes to the L2 algorithm include scaling the O2-A band spectroscopy (reducing XCO2 bias by 4 or 5 ppm); using interpolation with the instrument lineshape [ ILS ] (reducing XCO2 bias by 1.5 ppm); and fitting a zero level offset to the A-band. Users have to also carefully familiarize themselves with the disclaimer in the new documentation. \n\nAn important element to note are the updates on data screening. Although a Master Quality Flag is provided in the data product, further analysis of a larger set of data has allowed the science team to provide an updated set of screening criteria. These are listed in the data user's guide, and are recommended instead of the Master Quality Flag.\n\n\nLastly, users should continue to carefully observe and weigh information from three important flags:\n \n\n      \"sounding_qual_flag\" - quality of input data provided to the retrieval processing    \n\n      \"outcome_flag\" - retrieval quality based upon certain internal thresholds (not thoroughly evaluated)    \n\n        ",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_SSMI_DMSP13_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar IFOV for each swath. This is a single-frequency retrieval that relies on Ka-band data only. While the 2ADPR dual-frequency retrieval should give better overall estimates, that algorithm requires co-aligned Ku-band data. This 2AKa product will be produced independently and would not be impacted by any operational issues with the Ku-band radar.

For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.\n\n",

The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data set, GLDAS-2.0 monthly 1.0 degree, contains a series of land surface variables generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.0 3-hourly data simulated from the Catchment Land Surface Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in netCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO’s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.",

For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD.

There are two grid resolutions: 5.0 degrees and 25 kms. For each grid box, the core statistics are the number of measurements, mean, and standard deviation. Most variables are also conditioned on surface type and precipitation type with other three-dimensional fields adding the height above the ellipsoid. Unless otherwise specified, the means are conditioned on precipitation being present (rain rate &gt; 0). For the daily product, the mean square statistic is saved rather than the standard deviation. In addition to the daily and monthly products is a simplified joint daily product that contains a subset of the fields from the full daily product.",

The vertical coverage is from 215 to 0.001 hPa.\n\nThe MLS NRT algorithm uses a simplified fast forward model to meet Near Real Time data latency requirements and are therefore not as accurate as the retrievals that constitute the standard MLS products. Nevertheless the results are scientifically useful in selected regions of the Earth's atmosphere provided that the data are screened according to the recommendations in the MLS NRT User Guide and the MLS L2 Data Quality Document for Standard Products.",

There are two Level-2 Aura OMI aerosol products OMAERO and OMAERUV. The OMAERUV product uses the near-UV algorithm. The OMAERO (13x24 km resolution) and OMAEROZ (13x12 km resolution) is based on the multi-wavelength algorithm that uses up to 20 wavelength bands between 331 nm and 500 nm. The multi-wavelength retrieval algorithm is developed by the KNMI OMI Team Scientists. Drs. Deborah Stein-Zweers, Martin Sneep and Pepijn Veefkind are now the key investigators of this product. The OMAEROZ products contain Aerosol Optical Depths, Single Scattering Albedo, Aerosol Type, Aerosol Layer Height, and other intermediate and ancillary parameters and geolocation information.\n\nThe OMAEROZ files are stored in the version 5 EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). OMAEROZ data files are based on Zoomed Level 1B radiance observations which are made once a month. Thus there is one day of zoomed data (approximately 14 orbits) per month. The maximum file size for the OMAEROZ data is about 11 Mbytes.\n\nA Readme document containing brief algorithm description and known data quality related issues and file specifications are provided by the OMAERO Algorithm lead.",

The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nCopernicus Sentinel-5P TROPOMI aerosol layer height algorithm applies a forward model, which includes DISAMAR (Determining Instrument Specifications and Analyzing Methods for Atmospheric Retrieval, a Layer-Based Orders of Scattering algorithm) to calculate monochromatic reflectance, and also employs a neural network scheme for speedy processor performance. Data retrieval uses the Optimal Estimation Method (OEM) for spectral fitting with various aerosol layer pressures and aerosol optical thicknesses in the Oxygen-A band (758 -770nm). The aerosol baseline model assumes a single uniformly distributed aerosol layer with a fixed pressure thickness and a constant aerosol volume extinction coefficient and single scattering albedo. The aerosol parameterization is particularly suitable for elevated non-scattering aerosols such as volcanic ash, desert dust and biomass burning plume. The product main outputs include the mid-pressure and mid-altitude of aerosol layers, aerosol optical thickness at 760nm, error estimates, and other relevant diagnostics.\n\nStarting from orbit #12432 on March 7th of 2020, the S-NPP auxiliary cloud data source used in the aerosol layer height product data processing has been transitioned from the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM) into the Enterprise Cloud Mask (ECM).",

This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder).

The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb.

The subset is processed at the Modeling and Assimilation Data and Information Services Center (MDISC) of the GES DISC, NASA. The algorithm first calculates coordinates along the CloudSat ground track as well as coordinates orthogonal to the CloudSat ground track to produce a swath co-instantiated with actual CloudSat coverage. The algorithm proceeds to extract the closest MERRA grid cell at each point within the co-instantiated swath and writes the output subset in HDF-EOS2 swath-format, one subset for each time stride for eight subsets per day. The swath has an along-track temporal resolution of 10 seconds and an across-track spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees. With 9 across-track bins, the resulting coverage is about 200km wide.\n\nAll original parameters are preserved in the subset. As it is collocated with CloudSat, the subset is automatically collocated with CALIPSO as well.\n    ",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n.\n\nThis is environmental data that includes the profiles of atmospheric parameters assumed in the L2 retrieval algorithm.\n\nThis GPM data type provides single- and dual-frequency-derived precipitation estimates from the Ku and Ka radars of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on the core GPM spacecraft. The output consists of three main classes of precipitation products derived from the: \n+ the Ku-band frequency over a wide swath (245 km);\n+ the Ka-band frequency over a narrow swath (125 km), and\n+ the dual-frequency data over the narrow swath. \n\nThe Ka-band results are further divided into the standard and high-sensitivity estimates. In the standard sensitivity mode, the fields of view within the inner swath are matched to those of the Ku-band. Data from these matched-beam Ku- and Ka-band fields of view are used to derive the dual-frequency precipitation products. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar instrument field of view (IFOV). \n\nThe dual-frequency retrieval benefits from having co-aligned measurements at Ku- and Ka-bands. Data from these measurements are used to infer properties of the particle size distribution, which are expected to lead to improved estimates of rainfall rate and equivalent liquid water content. Dual-frequency data are expected to improve the capability to discriminate among water, ice, and mixed-phase hydrometeors as a function of height. This capability is particularly important in convective storms where a bright-band signature, associated with mixed-phase hydrometeors, is usually not detectable. In addition, the different attenuation rates of the Ku- and Ka-bands allow differential attenuation techniques to be used to estimate the path integrated attenuation. The high-sensitivity Ka-band channel is expected to have 6 dB greater sensitivity than the Ku- and standard Ka-band channels and to provide enhanced detection capabilities at the light rainfall rates.",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\n   The 2AKa algorithm provides precipitation estimates from the Ka radar of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar on the core GPM spacecraft. The product contains two swaths of data corresponding to the scans of the Ka radar. The first swath contains matched scans (MS), which are intended to be co-aligned with the Ku-band instantaneous fields of view (IFOV). The second swath contains the high-sensitivity scans (HS), which are interleaved between the Ku/Ka-MS swaths. Both swaths are narrow and centered within the interior of the Ku swath. This is a single-frequency retrieval of precipitation; no information from the Ku radar is used. The retrievals are performed at each radar range bin along the slant path of the radar IFOV for each swath.\n\t\n   This is a single-frequency retrieval that relies on Ka-band data only. While the dual-frequency retrieval should give better overall estimates, that algorithm requires co-aligned Ku-band data. This 2AKa product will be produced independently and would not be impacted by any operational issues with the Ku-band radar. The high sensitivity to smaller hydrometeors should result in precipitation estimates in lighter precipitation then the Ku-only data.\n\n   It is important to note the difference between the single- and the dual-frequency (DF) algorithms. While this 2AKa dataset is a single-frequency retrieval, the DF algorithm employs both KuPR and KaPR L1B standard products as inputs. The DF algorithm cannot be executed unless both L1B products are available. Pixels observed by DPR can be categorized into three types: pixels in the inner swath of normal scans (observed both by KuPR and KaPR), pixels in the outer swath of normal scans (observed only by KuPR), and pixels in the interleaved scans (observed only by KaPR in the high-sensitivity mode). The KuPR algorithm is executed for pixels in both inner and outer swaths of normal scans. The KaPR algorithm is executed for pixels in the inner swath of normal scans and in the interleaved scans. The DF algorithm is executed for pixels of all the three kinds.\n\n",

In the DSM, the spacecraft is turned such that the normal Earth field of regard is deep space.\n\nThe thermal impact of the DSM caused a shift of the centroids of spectral response functions (SRF) of about 1% of the width of the SRF, equivalent to a frequency shift of 9 parts per million. This shift is reflected in the “spectral_freq” parameter (observed frequencies) in the L1b v5 files for each 6 minute granule. The magnitude of the effect on brightness temperatures (BT) depends on the spectral gradient of each channel. Maximum BT shifts are approximately +- 0.5 K, although many channels experience far smaller BT shifts. Approximately 1803 channels have BT shifts of less than 0.1 K and 575 channels are now shifted in BT by more than 0.1 K, while 231 of these channels have BT shifts greater than 0.2 K.\n\nUsers of the L1b v5 product who are concerned that these shifts may impact their science investigations and applications are encouraged to switch to the AIRS L1c v6.7.4 product, which, among many other improvements, converts the spectra to a fixed frequency grid.

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&amp;19, METOP A&amp;B), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AMSUB_NOAA17_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "title": "TOVS GLA MONTHLY GRIDS from NOAA-11 02 (TOVSAMNH) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMNH) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-11 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThese Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format. Each data set is representative of a different monthly average time period and for one of nine satellites. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid. For this NOAA-11 satellite the downlink of data was turned off in mid-1994 then reactivated in 1997. Therefore there is a gap in the monthly data products.",

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nThis data set,  GLDAS-2.0 VIC monthly 1.0 degree, contains a series of land surface variables generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.0 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC 4.1.2 Land Surface Model in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data set currently cover from January 1948 to December 2014, but will be extended as the forcing data becomes available. The GLDAS-2.0 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.0 model simulations were initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulations were forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006). Each simulation uses the common GLDAS data sets for land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009) and elevation (GTOPO30) along with the model default land cover and soils datasets. Catchment model uses the Mosaic land cover classification and soils, topographic, and other model-specific parameters were derived in a consistent manner as in the NASA/GMAO’s GEOS-5 climate modeling system. The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products.\n\nIn October 2020, all 3-hourly and monthly GLDAS-2 data were post-processed with the MOD44W MODIS land mask.  Previously, some grid boxes over inland water were considered as over land and, thus, had non-missing values.  The post-processing corrected this issue and masked out all model output data over inland water; the post-processing did not affect the meteorological forcing variables. More information can be found in the GLDAS-2 README.  The MOD44W MODIS land mask is available on the GLDAS Project site.\n\nIf you had downloaded the GLDAS data prior to November 2020, please download the data again to receive the post-processed data.\n\n\n",

This product is similar to AIRX3STM. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 Monthly Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.

    "title": "Gridded 6 hours Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_MON_CONV_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the OMAerving system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the OMAerving system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nThe TROPOMI Carbon Monoxide total column applies a modified SWIR CO retrieval (SICOR) algorithm based on the CO absorption band between 2305 nm and 2385 nm. The S5P SICOR algorithm accounts for cloudy and aerosol loaded atmosphere conditions and is suitable for clear sky observations over land and cloudy observations over both land and oceans.",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nAll 1C products have a common L1C data structure, simple and generic. Each L1C swath includes scan time, latitude and longitude, scan status, quality, incidence angle, Sun glint angle, and the intercalibrated brightness temperature (Tc). One or more swaths are included in a product. The radiometer data are recalibrated to a common basis so that precipitation products derived from them are consistent. 1CSSMIS contains common calibrated brightness temperature from the SSMIS passive microwave instruments flown on the DMSP satellites. Swath S1 has 3 low frequency channels (19V 19H 22V). Swath S2 has 2 low frequency channels (37V 37H). Swath S3 has 4 high frequency channels (150H 183+/-1H 183+/-3H 183+/-7H). S4 has 2 high frequency channels (91V 91H). All the above frequencies are in GHz. Earth observations for all four swaths are taken during a 144o segment of the instrument rotation when SSMIS scans in the direction of foreward satellite motion. We define the spacecraft vector (v) at the center of this segment.",

Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other.

SCAMS was designed to map tropospheric temperature profiles, water vapor abundance, and cloud water content to be used for weather prediction even in the presence of clouds, which block conventional satellite infrared sensors. The data, originally written on IBM 360 machines, were recovered from 9-track magnetic tapes. The data are archived in their original IBM 32-bit word binary record format, also referred to as a binary TAP file, and contain one orbit of measurements.                         \n\nThe SCAMS experiment on Nimbus-6 is a follow on to the successful Nimbus-5 NEMS experiment.  SCAMS continuously monitored emitted microwave radiation at frequencies of 22.235, 31.65, 52.85, 53.85 and 55.45 GHz. The three channels near the 5.0-mm oxygen absorption band were used primarily to deduce atmospheric temperature profiles. The two channels near 10 mm permitted water vapor and cloud water content over calm oceans to be estimated separately. The instrument, a Dicke-superheterodyne type, scanned +/- 45 degrees normal to the orbital plane with a 10 degree field of view. The three oxygen channels shared common signal and reference antennas. Both water vapor channels had their own signals and reference antennas. The absolute rms accuracy of the oxygen channels was better than 2 Kelvin and that of the water vapor channels better than 1 Kelvin.                               \nThe SCAMS Principal Investigator was Prof. David H.

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration.

A single time-independent site-specific Air-Mass Factor (AMF) value for each site was calculated (McLinden et al., 2014) and applied consistently to each satellite SCD dataset to derive SO2 vertical column densities (VCDs=SCDs/AMFs). The emission estimate method is based on a fit of satellite VCDs to an empirical plume model developed to describe the SO2 spatial distribution near emission point sources. The plume model assumes that the SO2 concentrations emitted from a point source decline exponentially with distance and that they are affected by turbulent diffusion that can be described by a two-dimensional (2D) exponentially modified Gaussian function. The total SO2 mass is derived from the fit and the annual emission rate is calculated as the ratio between the total mass and the prescribed SO2 lifetime.",

    "description": "This is a CloudSat-collocated subset of the original product OMSO2, for the purposes of the A-Train mission.  The goal of the subset is to select and return OMI data that are within +/-100 km across the CloudSat track. The resultant OMI subset swath is sought to be about 200 km cross-track of CloudSat. Even though collocated with CloudSat, this subset can serve many other A-Train applications.\n\n(The shortname for this CloudSat-collocated subset of the original product OMSO2 Product is OMSO2_CPR_V003)\n            \nThis document describes the original OMI SO2 product (OMSO2) produced from global mode UV measurements of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). OMI was launched on July 15, 2004 on the EOS Aura satellite, which is in a sun-synchronous ascending polar orbit with 1:45pm local equator crossing time. The data collection started on August 17, 2004 (orbit 482) and continues to this day with only minor data gaps. The minimum SO2 mass detectable by OMI is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the detection threshold of the legacy Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) SO2 data (1978-2005) [Krueger et al 1995]. This is due to smaller OMI footprint and the use of wavelengths better optimized for separating O3 from SO2.\n\nThe product file, called a data granule, covers the sunlit portion of the orbit with an approximately 2600 km wide swath containing 60 pixels per viewing line. During normal operations, 14 or 15 granules are produced daily, providing fully contiguous coverage of the globe. Currently, OMSO2 products are not produced when OMI goes into the \"zoom mode\" for one day every 452 orbits (~32 days). For each OMI pixel we provide 4 different estimates of the column density of SO2 in Dobson Units (1DU=2.69x10^16 molecules/cm2) obtained by making different assumptions about the vertical distribution of the SO2. However, it is important to note that in most cases the precise vertical distribution of SO2 is unimportant. The users can use either the SO2 plume height, or the center of mass altitude (CMA) derived from SO2 vertical distribution, to interpolate between the 4 values: \n\n1)Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) SO2 column (ColumnAmountSO2_PBL), corresponding to CMA of 0.9 km.\n2)Lower tropospheric SO2 column (ColumnAmountSO2_TRL), corresponding to CMA of 2.5 km.\n3)Middle tropospheric SO2 column, (ColumnAmountSO2_TRM), usually produced by volcanic degassing, corresponding to CMA of 7.5 km,  \n4)Upper tropospheric and Stratospheric SO2 column (ColumnAmountSO2_STL), usually produced by explosive volcanic eruption, corresponding to CMA of 17 km. \n\nThe accuracy and precision of the derived SO2 columns vary significantly with the SO2 CMA and column amount, observational geometry, and slant column ozone. OMI becomes more sensitive to SO2 above clouds and snow/ice, and less sensitive to SO2 below clouds. Preliminary error estimates are discussed below (see Data Quality Assessment). \n\nOMSO2 files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format\n(HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an\norbit (53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The\nmaximum file size for the OMSO2 data product is about 9 Mbytes.",

    "title": "Aqua/AIRS L3 Monthly Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS+AMSU+HSB) 1 degree x 1 degree V7.0 at GES DISC",
    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX3STM. However, it contains science retrievals that use the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The AIRS Level 3 Monthly Gridded Retrieval Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a calendar month. The mean values are simply the arithmetic means of the daily products, weighted by the number of input counts for each day in that grid box. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone. The actual names of the variables in the data files should be inferred from the Processing File Description document.",

Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThis product contains the calibrated received power from the Ka-band of the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) aboard the core satellite of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission.\n\nOne of the reasons for adding the Ka-band frequency (35.5 GHz) channel to the DPR is to provide information on the drop-size distribution that can be obtained from non-Rayleigh scattering effects at the higher frequency. Another reason for the new Ka-band channel is to provide more accurate estimates of the phase-transition height in precipitating systems. This information is very important not only in increasing the accuracy of rain rate estimation by the DPR itself, but in improving rain estimation by passive microwave radiometers.\n\nThe Ka-band Radar has a more complex scanning geometry, defined by two modes: Matched (MS) and High-sensitivity (HS). In the first type of scan (MS), the Ka Radar beams are matched to the central 25 beams of the Ku Radar, providing a swath of 120 km (within the 245km swath of the Ku Radar). In the second type of scan (HS), the Ka is operated in the high-sensitivity mode to detect light rain and snow.  In this case, its beams are interlaced within the matched scan pattern, resulting in 49 cross-track beams which, however, still cover the 120-km swath.  \n",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_SSU_NOAA14_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) Level 2 Near Real Time (NRT) Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) product (AIRS2RET_NRT_006) differs from the routine product (AIRS2RET_006) in four ways to meet the three hour latency requirements of the Land Atmosphere NRT Capability Earth Observing System (LANCE): (1) The NRT granules are produced without previous or subsequent granules if those granules are not available within 5 minutes, (2) the predictive ephemeris/attitude data are used rather than the definitive ephemeris/attitude, (3) if the forecast surface pressure is unavailable, a surface climatology is used, and (4) no ice cloud properties retrievals are performed. The consequences of these differences are described in the AIRS Near Real Time (NRT) data products document. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is produced using AIRS IR only because the radiometric noise in AMSU channel 4 started to increase significantly (since June 2007). The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. Estimates of the errors associated with these quantities is also part of the Standard Product. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 28 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at 14 atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 50 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km. An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 lines along track. There are 240\ngranules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

    "description": "The Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument measures surface mineralogy, targeting the Earth’s arid dust source regions. EMIT is installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and uses imaging spectroscopy to take measurements of the sunlit regions of interest between 52° N latitude and 52° S latitude. An interactive map showing the locations of methane plumes along with metadata, regions being investigated, current and forecasted data coverage, and additional data resources can be found on the VSWIR Imaging Spectroscopy Interface for Open Science (VISIONS) EMIT Open Data Portal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its primary objective described above, EMIT has demonstrated the capacity to characterize methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) point-source emissions by measuring gas absorption features in the short-wave infrared bands. The EMIT Level 2B Greenhouse Gas (GHG) series of products can be used to identify and quantify point source emissions. The EMIT Level 2B Estimated Methane Plume Complexes (EMITL2BCH4PLM) Version 1 data product provides estimated methane plume complexes in parts per million meter (ppm m) along with uncertainty data. The EMITL2BCH4PLM data product will only be generated where methane plume complexes have been identified. To reduce the risk of false positives, all EMITL2BCH4ENH data undergo a manual review (or identification and confirmation) process before being designated as a plume complex. For more information on the manual review process, see Section 4.2.2 of the EMIT GHG Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD). Each EMITL2BCH4PLM granule is sized to a specific plume complex but may cross multiple EMITL2BCH4ENH granules. A list of source EMITL2BCH4ENH granules is included in the GeoTIFF file metadata as well as the GeoJSON file. Each EMITL2BCH4PLM granule contains two files: one Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) file at a spatial resolution of 60 meters (m) and one GeoJSON file. The EMITL2BCH4PLM COG file contains a raster image of a methane plume complex extracted from EMITL2BCH4ENH v001 data. The EMITL2BCH4PLM GeoJSON file contains a vector outline of the plume complex, a list of source scenes, coordinates of the maximum enhancement values, and the uncertainty of the plume complex.",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 07. \n\nThe \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&amp;19, METOP A&amp;B), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty. ABSTRACT",

    "description": "The \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. \n\nThe Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.\n\nFundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).\n\nThe algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.\n\n",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AMSUA_AQUA_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The NRT data are typically available within 3 hours of observation and are broken into files containing about 15 minutes of data. The most recent 7 days of data are available online. Spatial coverage is near-global (-82 degrees to +82 degrees latitude), with each profile spaced 1.5 degrees or ~165 km along the orbit track (roughly 15 orbits per day). The vertical coverage is from 100 to 1 hPa.\n\nThe MLS NRT algorithm uses a simplified fast forward model to meet Near Real Time data latency requirements and are therefore not as accurate as the retrievals that constitute the standard MLS products. Nevertheless the results are scientifically useful in selected regions of the Earth's atmosphere provided that the data are screened according to the recommendations in the MLS NRT User Guide and the MLS L2 Data Quality Document for Standard Products.",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07. \n\nThe 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: \n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (Aqua)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) \n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. \n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

    "description": "TMPA (3B40RT) dataset have been discontinued as of Dec. 31, 2019, and users are strongly encouraged to shift to the successor IMERG datasets (doi: 10.5067/GPM/IMERG/3B-HH-E/06, 10.5067/GPM/IMERG/3B-HH-L/06).\n\n These data were output from the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), the Near Real-Time (RT) processing stream.  The latency was about seven hours from the observation time, although processing issues may delay or prevent this schedule. Users should be mindful that the price for the short latency of these data is the reduced quality as compared to e.g. research quality product 3B42.  This particular dataset is an intermediate high-quality (HQ) estimate from merged Microwave precipitation estimates.\n\nData files start with a header consisteing  of a 2880-byte header record containing ASCII characters. The header line makes the file nearly self-documenting, in particular spelling out the\nvariable and version names, and giving the units of the variables. Immediately after the header follow the data fields.  All fields are 1440x720 grid boxes (0-360�E,90�N-S). The first grid box center is at (0.125�E,89.875�N).  The grid increments most rapidly to the east.  Grid boxes without valid data are filled with the (2-byte integer) \"missing\" value -31999. Estimates are only computed for the band 70�N-S. This binary data sets are in IEEE ?big-endian? floating-point format.\n\nFiles are produced every 3 hours on synoptic observation hours (00, 03, ..., 21 UTC) as an accumulation of all HQ swath data observed within +/-90 minutes of the nominal file time. I.e. Each file is a snapshot considered to represent the three-hour period centered on the \"nominal\" file time.  So, e.g., 00 UTC nominally represents the period from 2230 UTC of the previous day to 0130 UTC of the current day.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_SSMI_DMSP13_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMNF) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-9 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThese Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

Although this product is called Deep Blue based on retrievals for the land algorithm, the data includes over-water retrievals as well.\r\n\r\nThe Deep Blue algorithm draws its heritage from previous applications to retrieve AOT from Sea‐viewing Wide Field‐of‐view Sensor (SeaWiFS) over both land and ocean and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements over land.  This L2 description pertains to the VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol Version 2.0 (V2.0) product, whose record starts from February 17, 2018.\r\n\r\nThe L2 netCDF product, acquired every 6 minutes, contains 55 Science Data Set (SDS) layers. The V2.0 VIIRS deep blue aerosol products are available from both NOAA20 and SNPP platforms. Significant changes have been made to the V2.0 Deep Blue/SOAR algorithms to further improve the data quality.    A number of other improvements and changes have been added that can be found from Product page at:\r\nhttps://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/products/AERDB_L2_VIIRS_NOAA20\r\n\r\nConsult the VIIR Deep Blue product user guide for additional information regarding the global attributes, data field attributes, quality flags, software to handle and use these data products, etc., at: \r\nhttps://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/v2/content/archives/Document%20Archive/Science%20Data%20Product%20Documentation/VIIRS_Deep_Blue_Aerosol_User_Guide_v2.pdf",

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available.

    "title": "Goddard Satellite-Based Surface Turbulent Fluxes, 1x1 deg Monthly Grid, Set1 and Interpolated Data V2c (GSSTFM) at GES DISC",
    "description": "These data are the Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes Version-2c Dataset recently produced through a MEaSUREs funded project led by Dr. Chung-Lin Shie (UMBC/GEST, NASA/GSFC), converted to HDF-EOS5 format. The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. \n\nGSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the \"artifactitious\" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently. \n\nGSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful \"Rice Cooker Theory\" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., \"To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality\" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c.\n      \n      This is the Monthly product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. The monthly product is a result of averaging of a month worth of daily GSSTF2c files. Starting with Version 2c, there is only one set of Combined data, \"Set1\".  A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3.\n\n      The monthly temporal and one-degree spatial resolution of the product can be used to examining climate variability at these scales. Oceanic evaporation contributes to the net fresh water input to the oceans and drives the upper ocean density structure and consequently the circulation of the oceans.\n\n     The short name for this product is GSSTFM.\n",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AMSUA_NOAA15_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "Version 6 is the current version of this dataset. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 6.\n\nThe Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.\n\nFundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).\n\nThe algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.\n\n",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07. \n\nThe 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: \n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) \n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. \n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_AMSUA_NOAA16_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other.

    "description": "The \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. \n\n\nThe Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.\n\nFundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model\ndata) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).\n\nThe algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.\n\n",

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The AIRS Infrared (IR) level 1C data set contains AIRS infrared calibrated and geolocated radiances in W/m2/micron/ster. This data set is generated from AIRS level 1B data. The spectral coverage of L1C data is from 3.74 to 15.4 mm. The nominal spectral resolution lambda / delta lambda = 1200. The spectrum is sampled twice per spectral resolution element in a total of 2645 spectral channels. A day of AIRS data is divided into 240 granules (scenes) each of 6-minute duration. For the AIRS IR measurements, an individual granule contains 135 pixels across-track and 90 along-track pixels; there are total of 135 x 90 = 12,150 pixels per granule. AIRS employs a 49.5 degree crosstrack scanning with a 1.1 degree instantaneous field of view (IFOV) to provide twice daily coverage of essentially the entire globe in a 1:30 PM sun synchronous orbit with the 13.5 x 13.5 km2 spatial resolution at nadir. The L1C swath products are derived from the L1B swath products. The primary purpose of the level 1C is to generate the spectra of radiances without spectral gaps caused by the instrument design and bad spectral points.

    "description": "Version 6 is the current version of this dataset. Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 6.\n\nThe Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations. This fulfils in part the essence of GPM (and its predecessor, TRMM) in which the core observatory acts as a calibrator of precipitation retrievals for the international constellation of passive microwave instruments. In doing so the retrievals from the partner constellation sensors are able to provide greater temporal sampling and great spatial coverage than is possible from the DPR instrument alone. However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.  \n\nFundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).\n\nThe algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines. In addition to the actual precipitation estimate, an assessment of the error is made, and a measure of the ‘fit’ of the observations to the database provided. A quality flag is also provided, with any bad data generating a ‘missing flag’ in the retrieval.\n\n",

I.e. the resultant MODIS subset swath is sought to be about 200 km cross-track. Geolocations in the original product, however, are subsampled at 5-km, and thus the crosss-track width of the subset geolocations is 41 pixels. The subset Cloud Mask has 201 pixels across-track. However, some of the Cloud Mask information is at bit level, thus allowing storing actually 250-m information in seemingly 1-km pixels. This is achieved by reserving 2 bytes (the last two out of six) of every 1-km pixel as 16 yes/no-cloud bits. Each one of these 16 bits flags a corresponding 250-m tile inside the 1-km pixel. Their state is described in the local attributes to the Cloud_Mask HDF data set, and accordingly must be interprated as 0=YES, 1=NO. Thus the effective cross-track width, for these two bytes only, is 804 tiles of 250-m denomination.\n      \nAlong-track, all MODIS pixels from the original product are preserved. \n      \nIn the standard product, the MODIS level-2 cloud mask product is a global product generated for both daytime &amp; nighttime conditions at 1-km spatial resolution (at nadir) and for daytime at 250-m resolution.

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_MSU_NOAA11_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The rationale of the project is to reduce the error from the input meteorological forcing and provide a variety of widely-used PET methods for different research and application purposes.\n\nPET is estimated using three methods: Penman open-water method (Penman), Priestley-Taylor method (PT), Reference crop evapotranspiration using the UN Food and Agricultural Organization approach (FAO). The Penman equation assumes PET occurs from an open water surface and calculates PET based on observations of surface net radiation, near-surface air temperature, wind speed, and specific humidity (Shuttleworth, 1993). The PT equation calculates PET based on surface net radiation and near-surface air temperature and does not account for the aerodynamic component (Priestley and Taylor, 1972). The FAO equation is a specific application of the Penman-Monteith equation for crop and short-grass reference surfaces and is based on surface net radiation, near-surface air temperature, wind speed, and specific humidity (Allen, 1998).  As a follow-on to PET_PU_3H025 Version 1, PET_PU_3H025 Version 2 seeks to continue to reduce the error from the input meteorological forcing and provide a variety of widely-used PET methods for different research and application purposes.

The AIRS instrument is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS in combination with the AMSU constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the specific quality control (QC) methodology. Specific QC accepts profile level from the top of the atmosphere down to the level where the QC determines that it is still good. Below this level, the data is rejected.\n\n",

Meteorological fields from the WRF model are used to drive STILT. STILT applies a Lagrangian particle dispersion model backwards in time from a measurement location (the \"receptor\" location), to create the adjoint of the transport model in the form of a \"footprint\" field. The footprint, with units of mixing ratio  per surface flux, quantifies the influence of upwind surface fluxes on greenhouse gas concentrations measured at the receptor and is computed by counting the number of particles in a surface-influenced volume and the time spent in that volume. For each column observation location, the receptors are located at 23 discrete vertical levels throughout the atmospheric column.  The CMS program is designed to make significant contributions in characterizing, quantifying, understanding, and predicting the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks through improved monitoring of carbon stocks and fluxes. The System uses NASA observations and modeling/analysis capabilities to establish the accuracy, quantitative uncertainties, and utility of products for supporting national and international policy, regulatory, and management activities.

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. This precipitation estimate from AIRS IR only is using a TOVS-like algorithm, and is intended for merging into the precipitation product of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). The precipitation estimate from AIRS Level 2 Support product, which are 6-min swath granules (240 per day) are combined here into one daily \"Level 2G\" global grid with dimensions (24x1440x720). Thus every hour is a \"layer\", and the resulting grid cell size is 0.25 degree (~25 km). Thus the grid size is made to fit TRMM products. Since AIRS precipitation is retrieved at AMSU footprint resolution, which is about 45 km at nadir, many grid cells in this 0.25-deg grid are \"empty\". The data are stored such that the first line is the South Pole. The geolocation information for every hour-layer is also provided in the file.",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.2 is new to the GES DISC archive and currently includes a main product from CLSM-F2.5 with Data Assimilation for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE-DA) from February 2003 to present.  The GLDAS-2.2 data are available in two production streams: one with GRACE data assimilation outputs (the main production stream), and one without GRACE-DA (the early production stream).  Since the GRACE data have a 2-6 month latency, the GLDAS-2.2 data are first created without GRACE-DA, and are designated as the Early Product (EP), with about 1 month latency.  Once the GRACE data become available, the GLDAS-2.2 data are processed with GRACE-DA in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Product archive. \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.2 Catchment Land Surface Model daily 0.25 x 0.25 degree with GRACE-DA. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.2 GARCE-DA product was simulated with Catchment-F2.5 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 24 land surface fields from February 1, 2003 to present.\n\nThe simulation started on February 1, 2003 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 Daily Catchment model simulation, forced with the meteorological analysis fields from the operational European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System.  The total terrestrial water anomaly observation from GRACE satellite was assimilated (Li et al, 2019). Due to the data agreement with ECMWF, this GLDAS-2.2 daily product does not include the meteorological forcing fields.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.2 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

Most variables are also conditioned on surface type and precipitation type with other three-dimensional fields adding the height above the ellipsoid. Unless otherwise specified, the means are conditioned on precipitation being present (rain rate &gt; 0). For the daily product, the mean square statistic is saved rather than the standard deviation.

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_HIRS3_NOAA16_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

This product is similar to AIRX2SUP. However, it contains science retrievals that use the HSB. Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product, plus intermediate outputs (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. An AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data with 30 footprints cross track by 45 scanlines of AMSU-A data or 135 scanlines of AIRS and HSB data.

For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.\n\n\n",

    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "The Multi-Sensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP) data set contains monthly 1.0-degree ocean-only estimates of cloud liquid water path (MACLWP_mean), total water path (MACTWP_mean) which includes both cloud and rain water, and monthly climatologies of cloud liquid water path diurnal cycle amplitudes and phases (MACLWP_diurnal).  The MACTWP_mean field can also be used as a quality-control screen for the MACLWP_mean field as discussed in Elsaesser et al. (2017), where uncertainty increases as the ratio of cloud to total water path increases.  The MAC-LWP algorithm uses as input the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) Version 7 0.25 degree-resolution retrieval products (produced using the SSM/I, AMSR-E, TMI, AMSR-2, GMI, SSMIS, and WindSat satellite sensors), and performs a bias correction on all input RSS cloud water path products based on AMSR-E matchups to clear-sky MODIS scenes.  The MAC-LWP algorithm ensures that spurious trends and variability in the cloud fields arising from drifting satellite overpass times are mitigated by simultaneously solving for the monthly average cloud and total water paths and monthly-mean diurnal cycles, as discussed in O&amp;#8217;Dell et al. (2008).  Additional details on the algorithm and data fields can be found in Elsaesser et al. (2017).",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&amp;19, METOP A&amp;B), ATMS (NPP), SAPHIR (MT1) This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation (obs) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_HIRS2_NOAA07_OBS) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "Starting from July 13th in 2020, five Sentinel-5P TROPOMI level-2 products including total and tropospheric column ozone, sulfur dioxide, CLOUD, and formaldehyde have been generated in processor version 2.\nFor data before July 13 of 2020, please check S5P_L2__O3_TCL_1 data collection.\n\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P or S5P) satellite mission is one of the European Space Agency's (ESA) new mission family - Sentinels, and it is a joint initiative between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the ESA. The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nCopernicus Sentinel-5P tropospheric ozone data products are retrieved by the convective-cloud-differential (CCD) algorithm to derive the tropospheric ozone columns and by the cloud slicing algorithm (CSA) to derive mean upper tropospheric ozone volume mixing ratios above the clouds. The S5P_TROPOZ_CCD algorithm uses TROPOMI Level-2 ozone column measurements and the cloud parameters provided by the S5P_CLOUD_OCRA and S5P_CLOUD_ROCINN, the average values of the tropospheric ozone columns below 270 hpa can be determined. The S5P_TROPOZ_CSA algorithm uses the correlation between could top pressure and the ozone column above the cloud. The retrieval depends on the amount of measurements with a high cloud cover. The products are restricted in the tropical region (-20 degrees to 20 degrees of latitude).\n\nThe main outputs of the Copernicus S5P/TROPOMI tropospheric ozone product include the tropospheric ozone column and corresponding errors, upper tropospheric ozone and corresponding errors, stratospheric ozone column and corresponding errors, and the retrieval quality flags. The data are stored in an enhanced netCDF-4 format.",

    "description": "WARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) and AMSU (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit). The AIRS instrument is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. The AIRS in combination with the AMSU constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of infrared and microwave sensors. The AIRS Standard Retrieval Product consists of retrieved estimates of cloud and surface properties, plus profiles of retrieved temperature, water vapor, ozone, carbon monoxide and methane. The temperature profile vertical resolution is 100 levels total between 1100 mb and 0.1 mb, while moisture profile is reported at atmospheric layers between 1100 mb and 300 mb. The horizontal resolution is 50 km.\n\nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n\nThis daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products applying the comprehensive quality control (QC) methodology. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables.\n\n",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 0.25 degree monthly dataset.   \n\nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation.

The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Forecast (omf) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_MSU_NOAA12_OMF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nCopernicus Sentinel-5P tropospheric ozone data products are retrieved by the convective-cloud-differential (CCD) algorithm to derive the tropospheric ozone columns and by the cloud slicing algorithm (CSA) to derive mean upper tropospheric ozone volume mixing ratios above the clouds. The S5P_TROPOZ_CCD algorithm uses TROPOMI Level-2 ozone column measurements and the cloud parameters provided by the S5P_CLOUD_OCRA and S5P_CLOUD_ROCINN, the average values of the tropospheric ozone columns below 270 hpa can be determined. The S5P_TROPOZ_CSA algorithm uses the correlation between could top pressure and the ozone column above the cloud. The retrieval depends on the amount of measurements with a high cloud cover. The products are restricted in the tropical region (-20 degrees to 20 degrees of latitude).\n\nThe main outputs of the Copernicus S5P/TROPOMI tropospheric ozone product include the tropospheric ozone column and corresponding errors, upper tropospheric ozone and corresponding errors, stratospheric ozone column and corresponding errors, and the retrieval quality flags.

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMTN) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from TIROS-N and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloud top height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThese Level 3 monthly mean products are in the netCDF format. Each data set is representative of a different monthly average time period and for one of nine satellites.  All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

The consequences of these differences are described in the AIRS Near Real Time (NRT) data products document. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is product produced using AIRS IR only because the radiometric noise in AMSU channel 4 started to increase significantly (since June 2007). The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product, plus intermediate outputs (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team.

    "description": "This data set provides the results of (1) year-round measurements of methane (CH4) flux along with soil and air temperatures at five eddy covariance towers at sites located in the Alaskan Arctic tundra from June 2013 to December 2014 and (2) airborne CH4 and ozone (O3) measurements collected during Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) flight campaigns for years 2012 through 2014. The included site-level flux data at half-hourly intervals were calculated following standard eddy covariance data processing procedures. Also reported are daily mean methane flux, soil temperature with depth, and air temperature for each tower site. Also identified for each flux tower site were the \"zero curtain\" periods of extended cold when soil temperatures were poised near 0 degrees C. The reported CARVE airborne CH4 and O3 data were aggregated horizontally at 5 km intervals. Measurement heights are reported. These aircraft positions were treated as receptors in a Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model coupled with meteorology fields from the polar variant of the Weather and Research Forecasting model (WRF), in order to model the land surface influence on the aircraft-observed methane concentrations. The summed land surface influence on the aircraft data at each position is reported. For each airborne measurement, 2D surface influence fields (i.e. footprints) at two different spatial resolutions were derived using the WRF-STILT simulations. These gridded footprints are provided as netCDF formatted files. Regional C-CH4 fluxes were calculated from the CARVE CH4 data and footprints for the period 2012-2014 and are also included with this data set.

    "description": "This data set provides Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) particle trajectory data products for particle receptors co-located with atmospheric column observations from the OCO-2 satellite. Meteorological fields from the WRF model are used to drive STILT. STILT applies a Lagrangian particle dispersion model backwards in time from a measurement location (the \"receptor\" location), to create the adjoint of the transport model in the form of a \"footprint\" field. The footprint, with units of mixing ratio  per surface flux, quantifies the influence of upwind surface fluxes on greenhouse gas concentrations measured at the receptor and is computed by counting the number of particles in a surface-influenced volume and the time spent in that volume. For each column observation location, the receptors are located at 14 discrete vertical levels throughout the atmospheric column.  The CMS program is designed to make significant contributions in characterizing, quantifying, understanding, and predicting the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks through improved monitoring of carbon stocks and fluxes. The System uses NASA observations and modeling/analysis capabilities to establish the accuracy, quantitative uncertainties, and utility of products for supporting national and international policy, regulatory, and management activities. CMS data products are designed to inform near-term policy development and planning.",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n\nThe 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:\n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) \n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) platform and use the Normal Spectral Resolution (NSR) data. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 1305 NSR infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (655-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2155-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CHART algorithm is uses the  basic cloud clearing and retrieval methodologies used including the definition and derivation of Jacobians, the channel noise covariance matrix, and the use of constraints including the background term, are essentially identical to those of AIRS Version-6.6 and previous AIRS Science Team retrieval algorithms.  As with the Version-6.6 AIRS system, the CHART algorithm uses a Neural Network system as an initial guess. The sounding retrieval methodology characterizes the full atmospheric state and the retrievals contains a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; outgoing longwave radiation (OLR); and an infrared-based precipitation estimate.\n\nThe CHART system was designed to serve as a seamless follow on to the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AIRS/AMSU) instrument processing system. For comparison, the AIRS/AMSU data collection AIRX2SUP contains similar meteorological information to this CHART data collection and the CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) data collection SNDRSNIML2CCPRETN contains CRIMSS data processed with an analogous algorithm.

    "description": "ACCLIP_AerosolCloud_AircraftRemoteSensing_WB57_Data is the cloud and aerosol remote sensing data from the Roscoe lidar collected during the Asian Summer Monsoon Chemical &amp; Climate Impact Project (ACCLIP). Data collection for this product is complete.\r\n\r\nACCLIP is an international, multi-organizational suborbital campaign that aims to study aerosols and chemical transport that is associated with the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) in the Western Pacific region from 15 July 2022 to 31 August 2022. The ASM is the largest meteorological pattern in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the summer and is associated with persistent convection and large anticyclonic flow patterns in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). This leads to significant enhancements in the UTLS of trace species that originate from pollution or biomass burning. Convection connected to the ASM occurs over South, Southeast, and East Asia, a region with complex and rapidly changing emissions due to its high population density and economic growth. Pollution that reaches the UTLS from this region can have significant effects on the climate and chemistry of the atmosphere, making it important to have an accurate representation and understanding of ASM transport, chemical, and microphysical processes for chemistry-climate models to characterize these interactions and for predicting future impacts on climate. The ACCLIP campaign is conducted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) with the primary goal of investigating the impacts of Asian gas and aerosol emissions on global chemistry and climate. The NASA WB-57 and NCAR G-V aircraft are outfitted with state-of-the-art sensors to accomplish this. ACCLIP seeks to address four scientific objectives related to its main goal. The first is to investigate the transport pathways of ASM uplifted air from inside of the anticyclone to the global UTLS. Another objective is to sample the chemical content of air processed in the ASM in order to quantify the role of the ASM in transporting chemically active species and short-lived climate forcing agents to the UTLS to determine their impact on stratospheric ozone chemistry and global climate. Third, information is obtained on aerosol size, mass, and chemical composition that is necessary for determining the radiative effects of the ASM to constrain models of aerosol formation and for contrasting the organic-rich ASM UTLS aerosol population with that of the background aerosols. Last, ACCLIP seeks to measure the water vapor distribution associated with the monsoon dynamical structure to evaluate transport across the tropopause and determine the role of the ASM in water vapor transport in the stratosphere.",

These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07. \n\nThe \"CLIM\"  products differ from their \"regular\" counterparts (without the \"CLIM\" in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n3GPROF products provide global gridded monthly/daily precipitation averages from multiple satellites that can be used for climate studies. The 3GPROF products are based on retrievals from high-quality microwave sensors, which are sensitive to liquid and ice-phase precipitation hydrometeors in the atmosphere.",

    "title": "ISLSCP II IGBP DISCover and SiB Land Cover, 1992-1993",
    "description": "This data set describes the geographic distributions of 17 classes of land cover based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere DISCover land cover legend (Loveland and Belward 1997) and the 15 classes of the SiB model processed at the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC). Specifically, the resampled DISCover datasets were derived from the 1km DISCover data set compiled by the USGS. The 1km data sets for each classification scheme were aggregated to 1, 0.5 and 0.25 degree spatial resolutions for this ISLSCP II data collection. Each layer of the aggregated products corresponds to a single DISCover land cover category and the values represent the percentage of the coarse resolution cell (1 degree, etc...)occupied by that land cover category. The dominant class data show the land cover category that occupies the majority of the cell and is derived from the percentage files for each cover type. The objective of this study was to create a land cover map derived from 1 kilometer AVHRR data using a full year of data (April 1992-March 1993). This thematic map was resampled to 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 degree grids for the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) data initiative II. During this re-processing, the original EDC land cover type and fraction maps were adjusted to match the water/land fraction of the ISLSCP II land/water mask. These maps were generated for use by global modelers and others. This data set is one of the products of the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP II) data collection which contains 50 global time series data sets for the ten-year period 1986 to 1995. Selected data sets span even longer periods. ISLSCP II is a consistent collection of data sets that were compiled from existing data sources and algorithms, and were designed to satisfy the needs of modelers and investigators of the global carbon, water and energy cycle. The data were acquired from a number of U.S. and international agencies, universities, and institutions. The global data sets were mapped at consistent spatial (1, 0.5 and 0.25 degrees) and temporal (monthly, with meteorological data at finer (e.g., 3-hour)) resolutions and reformatted into a common ASCII format. The data and documentation have undergone two peer reviews.ISLSCP is one of several projects of Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) [http://www.gewex.org/] and has the lead role in addressing land-atmosphere interactions -- process modeling, data retrieval algorithms, field experiment design and execution, and the development of global data sets.",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. \n\nThe 2AGPROF (also known as, GPM GPROF (Level 2)) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors: GMI, SSMI (DMSP F15), SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18) AMSR2 (GCOM-W1), TMI MHS (NOAA 18&amp;19, METOP A&amp;B), ATMS (SNPP and NOAA-20). This provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are near-realtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nCopernicus Sentinel-5P is flying in a loose formation with U.S. Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) so that S5P is able to utilize the high spatial resolution capability of the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument.

It infers a value for each grid point based on nearby and distant values of the input Level-2 datasets and estimates of the variance of those values, with lower variances given higher weight.\n\nThe Spatial Statistical Data Fusion (SSDF) surface continental United States (CONUS) products, fuse data from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) instrument on the EOS-Aqua spacecraft with data from the Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS) instruments on the Suomi-NPP spacecraft.  The CrIMSS instrument suite consists of the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) infrared sounder and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) microwave sounder.

Performing the data fusion of two (or more) remote sensing datasets that estimate the same physical state involves four major steps: (1) Filtering input data; (2) Matching the remote sensing datasets to an in situ dataset, taken as a truth estimate; (3) Using these matchups to characterize the input datasets via estimation of their bias and variance relative to the truth estimate; (4) Performing the spatial statistical data fusion. We note that SSDF can also be performed on a single remote sensing input dataset. The SSDF algorithm only ingests the bias-corrected estimates, their latitudes and longitudes, and their estimated variances; the algorithm is agnostic as to which dataset or datasets those estimates, latitudes, longitudes, and variances originated from.\n",

Each L1C swath includes scan time, latitude and longitude, scan status, quality, incidence angle, Sun glint angle, and the intercalibrated brightness temperature (Tc). One or more swaths are included in a product. The radiometer data are recalibrated to a common basis so that precipitation products derived from them are consistent. 1CSSMIS contains common calibrated brightness temperature from the SSMIS passive microwave instruments flown on the DMSP satellites. Swath S1 has 3 low frequency channels (19V 19H 22V). Swath S2 has 2 low frequency channels (37V 37H). Swath S3 has 4 high frequency channels (150H 183+/-1H 183+/-3H 183+/-7H). S4 has 2 high frequency channels (91V 91H). All the above frequencies are in GHz. Earth observations for all four swaths are taken during a 144o segment of the instrument rotation when SSMIS scans in the direction of foreward satellite motion. We define the spacecraft vector (v) at the center of this segment.",

The analyses are defined by interpolating station observations from GTS (Global Telecommunications System) gauges using the algorithm of Shepard (1968). The algorithm of Shepard (1968) has been widely used to interpolate gauge observations of monthly, pentad, and daily precipitation (Rudolf 1993, Xie et al. 1996). This algorithm is used to interpolate the irregularly distributed station observations onto grid points. The weighting coefficients are inversely proportional to the gauge-grid point distance and are adjusted by a cosine function taking into account the directional isolation of each gauge relative to all other nearby gauges. There are 6 data files with this data set.",

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available.

Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias.

It infers a value for each grid point based on nearby and distant values of the input Level-2 datasets and estimates of the variance of those values, with lower variances given higher weight.\n\nThe Spatial Statistical Data Fusion (SSDF) surface continental United States (CONUS) products, fuse data from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) instrument on the EOS-Aqua spacecraft with data from the Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS) instruments on the Suomi-NPP spacecraft.  The CrIMSS instrument suite consists of the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) infrared sounder and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) microwave sounder. These are all daily products on a ¼ x ¼ degree latitude/longitude grid covering the continental United States (CONUS).\n\nThe SSDF algorithm infers a value for each grid point based on nearby and distant values of the input Level-2 datasets and estimates of the variance of those values, with lower variances given higher weight. Performing the data fusion of two (or more) remote sensing datasets that estimate the same physical state involves four major steps: (1) Filtering input data; (2) Matching the remote sensing datasets to an in situ dataset, taken as a truth estimate; (3) Using these matchups to characterize the input datasets via estimation of their bias and variance relative to the truth estimate; (4) Performing the spatial statistical data fusion. We note that SSDF can also be performed on a single remote sensing input dataset. The SSDF algorithm only ingests the bias-corrected estimates, their latitudes and longitudes, and their estimated variances; the algorithm is agnostic as to which dataset or datasets those estimates, latitudes, longitudes, and variances originated from.\n",

In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is similar to AIRX2SUP. However, it contains science retrievals that use the HSB. Because the HSB instrument lived only from September 2002 through January 2003 when it terminally failed, the data set covers these five months only. The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product, plus intermediate outputs (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. \n\nAn AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data with 30 footprints cross track by 45 scanlines of AMSU-A data or 135 scanlines of AIRS and HSB data. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

    "title": "Gridded Monthly Time-Mean Observation minus Analysis (oma) Values 0.5 x 0.667 degree V001 (MA_SSU_NOAA09_OMA) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The differences between the observations and the forecast background used for the analysis (the innovations or O-F for short) and those between the observations and the final analysis (O-A) are by-products of any assimilation system and provide information about the quality of the analysis and the impact of the observations. Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

    "description": "The Simple Biosphere Model, Version 3 (SiB3) was used to produce a global data set of hourly carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere for the years 1998-2006. This data set represents the global net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere; specifically, the flux of CO2 between the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the surface vegetation layer. Following atmospheric convention, flux is defined as positive into the atmosphere and negative into the surface vegetation.The data reported are 9 years of estimated hourly carbon flux for 14637 land points. Units are moles C/m2/sec.Data are provided in two NetCDF formats: The NetCDF format provided by the investigators -- format designed specifically to minimize disk storage volume that excludes water grid cells, and  A CF Compliant NetCDF format -- generated by the ORNL DAAC that includes both land and water grid cells.The investigator provided NetCDF formatted files can be processed using the provided  FORTRAN code (sib_process_flux.f90) and the land mask (sib_mask.nc) into hourly, daily-mean, or monthly-mean fluxes on a global 1x1 degree Cartesian grid. The monthly-mean SiB3 fluxes were compared to TransCom flux data available for years 2000-2005 (Gurney et al., 2008) as a means of evaluating overall behavior of the model. In general, SiB3 fluxes are within the error bars of the TransCom results.The CF compliant NetCDF format files have been processed by the ORNL DAAC and the hourly and summarized daily-mean and monthly-mean flux data files are provided. GeoTIFF format files:In addition, the CF convention NetCDF files were converted to GeoTIFF image files by the ORNL DAAC and are included with the data set. Companion file:Additional information about the data formats, methodology, and data quality is found in the companion file: SiB3_carbon_flux_readme.pdfAccess to GeoTIFF format files via WCS Interface:The ORNL DAAC also provides access to the GeoTIFF files via a Web Coverage Service Interface (WCS). The OpenGIS Web Coverage Service Interface Standard (WCS) defines a standard interface and operations that enables interoperable access to geospatial coverages.These data are a carbon cycle reanalysis, which may be thought of as analogous to NCEP meteorological reanalysis products. Carbon fluxes have been used by a large community of atmospheric transport modelers to create reanalysis of CO2 concentrations and the results have been evaluated against observations. In addition, the reanalyzed flux and CO2 fields are important for designing future observing strategies for the global carbon cycle.",

    "description": "Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) is a 10-channel spectro-radiometer (317 – 780 nm) onboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) DSCOVR spacecraft located at the Earth-Sun Lagrange-1 (L-1) point giving EPIC a unique angular perspective that is used in science applications to measure ozone, aerosols, cloud reflectivity, cloud height, vegetation properties, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation estimates at Earth's surface. EPIC provides ten narrow-band spectral images of the entire sunlit face of the Earth using a 2048x2048 pixel Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detector coupled to a 30-cm aperture Cassegrain telescope. EPIC collects radiance data from the Earth and other sources through the Camera/Telescope Assembly. EPIC has a field of view (FOV) of 0.62 degrees, sufficient to image the entire Earth. Because of DSCOVR's tilted (Lissajous) orbit about the L‐1 point, the apparent angular size of the Earth varies from 0.45 to 0.53 degrees within its 6-month orbital period. Depending on the season, a complete set of per-band images is taken every 60 to 100 minutes.\r\n\r\nAccompanying instrument metadata and a series of calibrations and corrections are applied to convert the images to Level 1A format properly. The significant corrections are for flat‐fielding and stray light. Flat-fielding is based on measurements with a uniform light source to measure the differences in sensitivity for each of the 4 million pixels. The resulting correction map is applied to the estimated counts from the CCD. Stray light was measured in the laboratory using a series of small-diameter light sources entering the telescope and imaged on the CCD. A similar set of measurements has been performed on orbit using the moon. The illumination of pixels outside the primary diameter of the light source was measured to produce a detailed matrix map of the entire stray light function, and the resulting stray light correction was applied to every image. Other corrections are also used based on laboratory measurements. For wavelengths longer than 550 nm, there are back-to-front interference effects in the partially transparent CCD (etaloning) that must also be removed from measured radiance.\r\n\r\nThe Level 1B products contain calibrated and geolocated EPIC images with ancillary metadata. These data products are in HDF5 format.",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\n\nThe 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n\nThe 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:\n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)\n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty\n",

    "description": "The Multi-Sensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP) data set contains monthly 1.0-degree ocean-only estimates of cloud liquid water path (MACLWP_mean), total water path (MACTWP_mean) which includes both cloud and rain water, and monthly climatologies of cloud liquid water path diurnal cycle amplitudes and phases (MACLWP_diurnal).  The MACTWP_mean field can also be used as a quality-control screen for the MACLWP_mean field as discussed in Elsaesser et al. (2017), where uncertainty increases as the ratio of cloud to total water path increases.  The MAC-LWP algorithm uses as input the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) Version 7 0.25 degree-resolution retrieval products (produced using the SSM/I, AMSR-E, TMI, AMSR-2, GMI, SSMIS, and WindSat satellite sensors), and performs a bias correction on all input RSS cloud water path products based on AMSR-E matchups to clear-sky MODIS scenes.  The MAC-LWP algorithm ensures that spurious trends and variability in the cloud fields arising from drifting satellite overpass times are mitigated by simultaneously solving for the monthly average cloud and total water paths and monthly-mean diurnal cycles, as discussed in O&amp;#8217;Dell et al. (2008).  Additional details on the algorithm and data fields can be found in Elsaesser et al. (2017).",

This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01.

For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the NOAA-20 platform, also known as JPSS-1. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 FSR (Full Spectral Resolution) infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2100-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products with QC values of 0 (best), 1 (good), and 2 (don't use) which are provided for each variable.

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMND) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-12 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods include daily, 5 day (pentad) and monthly, with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

    "description": "Starting from August 6th in 2019, Sentinel-5P TROPOMI along-track high spatial resolution (~5.5km at nadir) has been implemented.\nStarting from July 13th in 2020, five Sentinel-5P TROPOMI level-2 products including total and tropospheric column ozone, sulfur dioxide, CLOUD, and formaldehyde have been generated in processor version 2.\nFor data before August 6th of 2019, please check S5P_L2__SO2____1 data collection.\nFor data between August 6th of 2019 and July 13th of 2020, please check S5P_L2__SO2____HiR_1 data collection.\nFor data after July 13th of 2020, please check S5P_L2__SO2____HiR_2 data collection.\n\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P or S5P) satellite mission is one of the European Space Agency's (ESA) new mission family - Sentinels, and it is a joint initiative between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the ESA. The sole payload on Sentinel-5P is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is a nadir-viewing 108 degree Field-of-View push-broom grating hyperspectral spectrometer, covering the wavelength of ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS, 270nm to 495nm), near infrared (NIR, 675nm to 775nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2305nm-2385nm). Sentinel-5P is the first of the Atmospheric Composition Sentinels and is expected to provide measurements of ozone, NO2, SO2, CH4, CO, formaldehyde, aerosols and cloud at high spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm for Sentinel-5P TROPOMI SO2 from ultraviolet spectral measurements is the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method. The relevant information of absorption cross section, instrument characteristics, cloud cover, and geolocation are utilized to derive SO2 slant column density (SCD). A sensitive spectral window of 312 to 326 nm is set as the baseline for the slant column fit with another two spectral windows (325 to 335 nm, 360 to 390 nm) to account for the non-linear effects in those high column amount cases. The SCD is then corrected with the empirical offsets to the systematic biases. The air mass factor (AMF) Look-up table has been created with the LIDORT radiative transfer model. The outputs of the DOAS algorithm are SO2 vertical column density (VCD), SCD, AMF, the DOAS-type averaging kernels (AK), and error estimates.",

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSA5ND) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-12 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period.

The emission sources represented in this dataset include fugitive emission sources from oil, gas, and coal exploitation following IPCC 2006 definitions and are estimated using bottom-up methods. The inventory emissions are based on individual country reports submitted in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). For those countries that do not report, the emissions are estimated following IPCC 2006 methods. Emissions are allocated to infrastructure locations including mines, wells, pipelines, compressor stations, storage facilities, processing plants, and refineries.\n  The purpose of the inventory is to be used as a prior estimate of fuel exploitation emissions in inverse modeling of atmospheric methane observations. GFEI only includes fugitive methane emissions from oil, gas, and coal exploitation activities and does not include any combustion emissions as defined in IPCC 2006 category 1A.\n The CMS program is designed to make significant contributions in characterizing, quantifying, understanding, and predicting the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks through improved monitoring of carbon stocks and fluxes. The System uses NASA observations and modeling/analysis capabilities to establish the accuracy, quantitative uncertainties, and utility of products for supporting national and international policy, regulatory, and management activities.

The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n\nThe 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:\n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)\n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty\n",

The goals of the ERBE were (1) to understand the radiation balance between the Sun, Earth, atmosphere, and space and (2) to establish an accurate, long-term baseline data set for detection of climate changes. Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) data are fundamental to the development of realistic climate models and to the understanding of natural and anthropogenic perturbations of the climate system. As part of ERBE, measurements of broadband shortwave radiation reflected from the Earth-atmosphere system were obtained, from which top of atmosphere albedo values were calculated. In addition, values from scenes determined to be free of clouds were analyzed separately and clear-sky albedos were derived. For this study, only the clear-sky albedos are included. The ERBE data sets for ISLSCP Initiative II contain global, top of atmosphere, clear sky albedo data from January 1986 to February 1990.",

We note that SSDF can also be performed on a single remote sensing input dataset.

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMNC) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-7 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occurring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThese Level 3 monthly mean products are in netCDF format. Each data set is representative of a different monthly average time period and for one of nine satellites. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

    "title": "Goddard Satellite-Based Surface Turbulent Fluxes, 1x1 deg Monthly Climatology, Set1 and NCEP V2c (GSSTFMC) at GES DISC",
    "description": "These data are the Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Fluxes Version-2c Dataset recently produced through a MEaSURES funded project led by Dr. Chung-Lin Shie (UMBC/GEST, NASA/GSFC), converted to HDF-EOS5 format. The stewardship of this HDF-EOS5 dataset is part of the MEaSUREs project. \n\nGSSTF version 2b (Shie et al. 2010, Shie et al. 2009) generally agreed better with available ship measurements obtained from several field experiments in 1999 than GSSTF2 (Chou et al. 2003) did in all three flux components, i.e., latent heat flux [LHF], sensible heat flux [SHF], and wind stress [WST] (Shie 2010a,b).  GSSTF2b was also found favorable, particularly for LHF and SHF, in an intercomparison study that accessed eleven products of ocean surface turbulent fluxes, in which GSSTF2 and GSSTF2b were also included (Brunke et al. 2011).  However, a temporal trend appeared in the globally averaged LHF of GSSTF2b, particularly post year 2000.  Shie (2010a,b) attributed the LHF trend to the trends originally found in the globally averaged SSM/I Tb's, i.e., Tb(19v), Tb(19h), Tb(22v) and Tb(37v), which were used to retrieve the GSSTF2b bottom-layer (the lowest atmospheric 500 meter layer) precipitable water [WB], then the surface specific humidity [Qa], and subsequently LHF. The SSM/I Tb's trends were recently found mainly due to the variations/trends of Earth incidence angle (EIA) in the SSM/I satellites (Hilburn and Shie 2011a,b).  They have further developed an algorithm properly resolving the EIA problem and successfully reproducing the corrected Tb's by genuinely removing the \"artifactitious\" trends.  An upgraded production of GSSTF2c (Shie et al. 2011) using the corrected Tb's has been completed very recently. \n\nGSSTF2c shows a significant improvement in the resultant WB, and subsequently the retrieved LHF - the temporal trends of WB and LHF are greatly reduced after the proper adjustments/treatments in the SSM/I Tb's (Shie and Hilburn 2011).  In closing, we believe that the insightful \"Rice Cooker Theory\" by Shie (2010a,b), i.e., \"To produce a good and trustworthy 'output product' (delicious 'cooked rice') depends not only on a well-functioned 'model/algorithm' ('rice cooker'), but also on a genuine and reliable 'input data' ('raw rice') with good quality\" should help us better comprehend the impact of the improved Tb on the subsequently retrieved LHF of GSSTF2c. \n\nThis is the Monthly Climatology product; data are projected to equidistant Grid that covers the globe at 1x1 degree cell size, resulting in data arrays of 360x180 size. Starting with Version 2c, there is only one set of Combined data, \"Set1\". The Monthly Climatology HDF-EOS5 file also contains one extra grid of NCEP Climatology, \"NCEP\". A finer resolution, 0.25 deg,  of this product has been released as Version 3.\n      \nThe monthly temporal and one-degree spatial resolution of the product can be used to examining climate variability at these scales. Oceanic evaporation contributes to the net fresh water input to the oceans and drives the upper ocean density structure and consequently the circulation of the oceans.\n\nThe short name for this product is GSSTFMC.\n",

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999).

With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available.

Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias.

    "description": "WARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the NOAA-20 platform, also known as JPSS-1. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 FSR (Full Spectral Resolution) infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2100-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis daily one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products with QC values of 0 (best), 1 (good), and 2 (don't use) which are provided for each variable. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables.\n\n",

    "title": "TOVS GLA MONTHLY GRIDS from NOAA-10 V01 (TOVSAMNG) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMNG) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-10 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are 6 level 3 data product files, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods include daily, 5 day (pentad) and monthly, with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

An interactive map showing the regions being investigated, current and forecasted data coverage, and additional data resources can be found on the VSWIR Imaging Spectroscopy Interface for Open Science (VISIONS) EMIT Open Data Portal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its primary objective described above, EMIT has demonstrated the capacity to characterize methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) point-source emissions by measuring gas absorption features in the short-wave infrared bands. The EMIT Level 2B Greenhouse Gas (GHG) series of products can be used to identify and quantify point source emissions. The EMIT Level 2B Methane Enhancement Data (EMITL2BCH4ENH) Version 1 data product is a total vertical column enhancement estimate of methane in parts per million meter (ppm m) based on an adaptive matched filter approach. EMITL2BCH4ENH provides per-pixel methane enhancement data used to identify methane plume complexes. The initial release of the EMITL2BCH4ENH data product will only include granules where methane plume complexes have been identified. Each granule contains one Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) file at a spatial resolution of 60 meters (m): Methane Enhancement (EMIT_L2B_CH4ENH). The EMITL2BCH4ENH file contains methane enhancement data based primarily on EMITL1BRAD radiance values.\r\n\r\nEach granule is approximately 75 kilometer (km) by 75 km, nominal at the equator, and some granules near the end of an orbit segment reaching 150 km in length.",

    "description": "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n\nThe 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:\n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19)\n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided.\n\nThe GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an apriori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty\n\n",

    "description": "GRACE non-tidal high-frequency atmospheric and oceanic mass variation models are routinely generated at GFZ as so-called Atmosphere and Ocean De-aliasing Level-1B (AOD1B) products (in terms of corresponding spherical harmonic geopotential coefficients) to be added to the background static gravity model during GRACE monthly gravity field determination. AOD1B products are 3-hourly series of spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 180 which are routinely provided to the GRACE Science Data System and the user community with only a few days time delay. These products reflect spatio-temporal mass variations in the atmosphere and oceans deduced from an operational atmospheric model and corresponding ocean dynamics provided by an ocean model. The variability is derived by subtraction of a long-term mean of vertical integrated atmospheric mass distributions and a corresponding mean of ocean bottom pressure as simulated with the ocean model. For further details, please refer to https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/aod1b/.\r\n\r\nThe Gridded AOD1B data sets provided here contain the monthly mean AOD1B data in geolocated gridded form, smoothed or spatially aggregated to be consistent with the GRACE and GRACE-FO Tellus Level-3 data products of land and/or ocean mass anomalies. With these gridded AOD1B Level-3 products, users can remove or add the effects of the modeled mean monthly atmospheric and ocean bottom pressure change (e.g., to compare different models).",

    "title": "TOVS GLA 5 DAY GRIDS from NOAA-10 V01 (TOVSA5NG) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This dataset (TOVSA5NG) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-10 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods include daily, 5 day (pentad) and monthly, with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid. These data products are 5 day averages.",

    "description": "This dataset (TOVSA5NH) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-11 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period.  All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs).

    "description": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) Level 2 Near Real Time (NRT) Support Retrieval (AIRS-only) product (AIRS2SUP_NRT_7.0) differs from the routine product (AIRS2SUP_7.0) in four ways to meet the three hour latency requirements of the Land Atmosphere NRT Capability Earth Observing System (LANCE): (1) The NRT granules are produced without previous or subsequent granules if those granules are not available within 5 minutes, (2) the predictive ephemeris/attitude data are used rather than the definitive ephemeris/attitude, (3) if the forecast surface pressure is unavailable, a surface climatology is used, and (4) no ice cloud properties retrievals are performed. The consequences of these differences are described in the AIRS Near Real Time (NRT) data products document. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is a grating spectrometer (R = 1200) aboard the second Earth Observing System (EOS) polar-orbiting platform, EOS Aqua. In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. This product is product produced using AIRS IR only because the radiometric noise in several AMSU channels started to increase significantly (since June 2007). The Support Product includes higher vertical resolution profiles of the quantities found in the Standard Product, plus intermediate outputs (e.g., microwave-only retrieval), research products such as the abundance of trace gases, and detailed quality assessment information. The Support Product profiles contain 100 levels between 1100 and .016 mb; this higher resolution simplifies the generation of radiances using forward models, though the vertical information content is no greater than that in the Standard Product profiles. The intended users of the Support Product are researchers interested in generating forward radiance or in examining research products, and the AIRS algorithm development team. The Support Product is generated at all locations as Standard Products. \n\nAn AIRS granule has been set as 6 minutes of data, 30 footprints cross track by 45 scanlines. There are 240 granules per day, with an orbit repeat cycle of approximately 16 day.",

These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions. These earlier data may be archived separately. The main strength of the product is the large sampling provided. The GPM radiometer algorithms are Bayesian-type algorithms. These algorithms search an a-priori database of potential rain profiles and retrieve a weighted average of these entries based upon the proximity of the observed brightness temperature (Tb) to the simulated Tb corresponding to each rain profile. By using the same a-priori database of rain profiles, with appropriate simulated Tb for each constellation sensor, the Bayesian method is completely parametric and thus well suited for GPM's constellation approach. The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible. Databases for V0 of the algorithm had to be constructed from various sources as described in the ATBD. The solution provides a mean rain rate as well as the vertical structure of cloud and precipitation hydrometeors and their uncertainty.",

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available.

Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other.

ARCTAS aimed to use detailed observations from aircraft to provide the validation, retrieval constraints, correlative data, and process information needed to better achieve the potential of satellites for Arctic research. The plan is for the combination of satellite and aircraft data to provide together powerful information for constraining and evaluating models of Arctic atmospheric composition and climate, and thus improve model projections of future change. \n\nThe first phase of ARCTAS was based in Fairbanks and Barrow, Alaska with some flights to Thule, Greenland in April and focused on thick aerosol layers known as &amp;#8220;arctic haze.&amp;#8221; The second phase followed in July based from Cold Lake, Alberta and the Northwest Territories focusing on the emissions from large boreal forest fires in northwest Canada. \n\nThis data set consists of observations made with the CAR instrument and includes values for bidirectional reflectance factor at varying spectral bands.",

    "description": "The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) is one of 10 sensors deployed in March of 2002 on board the polar-orbiting Envisat-1 environmental research satellite by the European Space Agency (ESA). The MERIS instrument is a moderate-resolution wide field-of-view push-broom imaging spectroradiometer capable of sensing in the 390 nm to 1040 nm spectral range. Being a programmable instrument, it had the unique capability of selectively adjusting the width and location of its 15 bands through ground command. The instrument has a 68.5-degree field of view and a swath width of 1150 meters, providing a global coverage every 3 days at 300 m resolution.  Communication with the Envisat-1 satellite was lost suddenly on the 8th of April, 2012, just weeks after celebrating its 10th year in orbit. All attempts to re-establish contact were unsuccessful, and the end of the mission was declared on May 9th, 2012.\r\n\r\nThe 4th reprocessing cycle, in 2020, has produced both the full-resolution and reduced-resolution L1 and L2 MERIS products. EN1_MDSI_MER_FRS_1P is the short-name for the MERIS Level-1 full resolution, full swath, geolocated and calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance product. This product contains the TOA upwelling spectral radiance measurements. The in-band reference irradiances for the 15 MERIS bands are computed by averaging the in-band solar irradiance for each pixel. Each pixel’s in-band solar irradiance is computed by integrating the reference solar spectrum with the band-pass of each pixel. The Level-1 product contains 22 data files: 15 files contain radiances for each band (one band per file) along with associated error estimates, and 7 annotation data files. It also includes a Manifest file that provides metadata information describing the product.",

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available.

    "description": "WARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov\n\nThe CLIMCAPS (Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Coupled Product System) algorithm is used to analyze data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (CrIS/ATMS) instruments, also known as CrIMSS (Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite). The CrIS/ATMS instruments used for this product are on board the NOAA-20 platform, also known as JPSS-1. The CrIS instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with a total of 2211 FSR (Full Spectral Resolution) infrared sounding channels covering the longwave (645-1095 cm-1), midwave (1210-1750 cm-1), and shortwave (2100-2550 cm-1) spectral regions. The ATMS instrument  is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels in spectral bands from 23 GHz through 183 GHz.\n \nThe CLIMCAPS algorithm uses an Optimal Estimation methodology and uses an a-priori first guess to start the process. A CLIMCAPS sounding is comprised of a set of parameters that characterizes the full atmospheric state and includes a variety of geophysical parameters derived from the CrIMSS data. These include surface temperature and infrared emissivity; full atmosphere profiles of temperature, water vapor and ozone; infrared effective cloud top characteristics; carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitric acid.\n \nThis monthly one degree latitude by one degree longitude level-3 product starts with level-2 retrieval products with QC values of 0 (best), 1 (good), and 2 (don't use) which are provided for each variable. Comprehensive QC accepts a retrieval if the profile is good to the surface and ensures consistent analysis across all levels and variables.\n\n",

    "description": "The Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) contains a wealth of information that can be used for weather and climate studies. By combining the assimilation of observations with a frozen version of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), a global analysis is produced at an hourly temporal resolution spanning from January 1980 through present (Gelaro et al., 2017). It can be difficult to parse through a multidecadal dataset such as MERRA-2 to evaluate the interannual variability of weather that occurs on a daily timescale, let alone determine the occurrence of an extreme weather event. This data collection is a climatological long term mean and standard deviation representing the interannual variability on a monthly timescale.\n\nFind the product File Specific, Readme, References, and data tools under \"Documentation\" tab.\n\nSign up for the MERRA-2 mailing list to receive announcements on the latest data information, tools and services that become available, data announcements from GMAO MERRA-2 project and more!

    "title": "TOVS GLA 5 DAY GRIDS from NOAA-9 V01 (TOVSA5NF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This dataset (TOVSA5NF) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-9 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the\ndifference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. This collection contains a 5 day average.",

Ozone retrievals are generated from the v8.6 SBUV algorithm. A Level-3 MZM file computes zonal means covering 5 degree latitude bands for each calendar month. For this product there are 72 months of data from May 1970 through April 1976. There are a total of 36 latitudinal bands, 18 in each hemisphere.

A good retrieval is defined as satisfying the following conditions:\n\n 1) Profile Error Flag = 0 or 1 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = solar zenith angle &gt; 84 degrees).\n 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle &gt; 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).\n\nNOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.\n\nThe zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria:\n\n 1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month.\n 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band.\n 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).",

GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 Noah 1.0 degree monthly dataset. \n\nThe monthly data product was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 Noah 3-hourly data simulated with the Noah Model 3.6 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 36 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nEstimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.\n\nThe method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types—convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)—were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The CSH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.\n\nBecause observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the CSH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.\n\nThe Gridded Orbital Spectral Latent Heating is actually one orbit gridded onto a global map with  0.25x0.25 degree grid cell size.

Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the \"CLIM\" output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n3GPROF products provide global gridded monthly/daily precipitation averages from multiple satellites that can be used for climate studies. The 3GPROF products are based on retrievals from high-quality microwave sensors, which are sensitive to liquid and ice-phase precipitation hydrometeors in the atmosphere.",

The coefficients are computed from the HIRDLS Level 2 profiles with a Kalman filter approach using both forward and backward passes in time. Expressed as the mean and up to 7 sine and cosine coefficients (4 waves for ascending and descending, 7 waves for combined), these coefficients may be used to compute values at any longitude. The data are provided on a pressure grid with 24 levels per decade, corresponding to about 1 km vertical resolution. The useful vertical range of the data is 215 to 20 hPa. The precision values are given by the root-mean square of the differences between the estimated fields and the input data.\n\nThe data are stored in the version 5 Hierarchical Data Format for the Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS5), which is an extension of the HDF5 format. Each file contains a zonal object with data for the entire mission with separate data fields for ascending (daytime), descending (nighttime), and combined orbit node.",

    "title": "TOVS GLA MONTHLY GRIDS from NOAA-9 V01 (TOVSAMNF) at GES DISC",
    "description": "This dataset (TOVSAMNF) contains the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) level 3 geophysical parameters derived using data from NOAA-9 and the physical retrieval method of Susskind et al. (1984) and processed by the Satellite Data Utilization Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA/GSFC. This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere. In addition to profiles of temperature and moisture, the HIRS2/MSU data are used to derive important quantities such as land and sea surface temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloudtop height, total ozone overburden and precipitation estimates.\n\nThe Path A system steps through an interactive forecast-retrieval-analysis cycle. In each 6 hour synoptic period, a 2nd order General Circulation Model (Takacs et al., 1994) is used to generate the 6 hour forecast fields of temperature and humidity. These global fields are used as the first guess for all soundings occuring within a 6 hour time window centered upon the forecast time. These retrievals are then assimilated with all available insitu measurements (such as radiosonde and ship reports) in the 6 hour interval using an Optimal Interpolation (OI) analysis scheme developed by the Data Assimilation Office of the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres. This analysis is then used to specify the initial conditions for the next 6 hour forecast, thus completing the cycle.\n\nThe retrieval algorithm itself is a physical method based on the iterative relaxation technique originally proposed by Chahine (1968). The basic approach consists of modifying the temperature profile from the previous iteration by an amount proportional to the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and the brightness temperatures computed from the trial parameters using the full radiative transfer equation applied at the observed satellite zenith angle. For the case of the temperature profile, the updated layer mean temperatures are given as a linear combination of multichannel brightness temperature differences with the coefficients given by the channel weighting functions. Constraints are imposed upon the solution in order to ensure stability and convergence of the iterative process. For more details see Susskind et al (1984).\n\nThere are level 3 data product files for five TOVS satellites, each of which is in the HDF format and each representative of a different averaging time period. All files contain the same number of geophysical parameter arrays stored as HDF Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). The time periods include daily, 5 day (pentad) and monthly, with the AM and PM portions of the orbits treated separately.  All data are mapped to a 1 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude global grid.",

    "description": "This data set provides level 2 (L2) calibrated hourly precipitation (cm/hr) from rain gauges at seven North American sites as part of the Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) project. Three gauges were installed at each site. Initial sampling began at three sites in September 2011 and additional sites were added during 2012 and 2013. All sampling concluded in December 2015. The AirMOSS project used an airborne radar instrument to estimate root-zone soil moisture at 10 study sites across North America. These precipitation data were collected in conjunction with in-ground soil moisture data in order to calibrate and validate the AirMOSS data.",

    "description": "DSCOVR_EPIC_L2_AER_03 is the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Enhanced Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) Level 2 UV Aerosol Version 3 data product. Observations for this data product are at 340 and 388 nm and are used to derive near UV (ultraviolet) aerosol properties. The EPIC aerosol retrieval algorithm (EPICAERUV) uses a set of aerosol models to account for the presence of carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning and wildfires (BIO), desert dust (DST), and sulfate-based (SLF) aerosols. These aerosol models are identical to those assumed in the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) algorithm (Torres et al., 2007; Jethva and Torres, 2011). \r\n\r\nAerosol data products generated by the EPICAERUV algorithm are aerosol extinction optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) at 340, 388, and 500 nm for clear sky conditions. AOD of absorbing aerosols above clouds is also reported (Jethva et al., 2018). In addition, the UV Aerosol Index (UVAI) is calculated from 340 and 388 nm radiances for all sky conditions. AOD is a dimensionless measure of the extinction of light y aerosols due to the combined effect of scattering and absorption. SSA represents the fraction of extinction solely due to aerosol scattering effects. The AI is a residual parameter that quantifies the difference in spectral dependence between measured and calculated near UV radiances, assuming a purely molecular atmosphere. Because most of the observed positive residuals are associated with absorbing aerosols, this parameter is commonly known as the UV Absorbing Aerosol Index. EPIC-derived aerosol parameters are reported at a 10 km (nadir) resolution.",

    "title": "ECOSTRESS Evaporative Stress Index dis-ALEXI USDA Daily L4 Global 30m V001",
    "description": "The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission measures the temperature of plants to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. ECOSTRESS is attached to the International Space Station (ISS) and collects data over the conterminous United States (CONUS) as well as key biomes and agricultural zones around the world and selected FLUXNET (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/about/) validation sites. A map of the acquisition coverage can be found on the ECOSTRESS website (https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/science).\r\n\r\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) ECO4ESIALEXIU Version 1 data product provides the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), which is computed from clear-sky estimates of the relative daily evapotranspiration (ET) fraction: ESI = ET/ETo, where ET is ETdaily from the ECOSTRESS Level 3 product and ETo is the reference ET. A description of the major components of the ECOSTRESS algorithm implemented in Version 1 of the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) Disaggregation algorithm (DisALEXI) ESI code is provided in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/340/ECO4ESIALEXIU_ATBD_V1.pdf). ESI applications include indicating agricultural drought and observing vegetation stress. The dis-ALEXI USDA ESI product is generated on a UTM grid at a spatial resolution of 30 meters.\r\n\r\nThe ECO4ESIALEXIU Version 1 data product contains layers of daily evaporative stress index, evaporative stress index uncertainty, and associated quality flags. A low-resolution browse is also available showing daily ESI as a stretched image with a color ramp in JPEG format.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues: *Data acquisition gaps: ECOSTRESS was launched on June 29, 2018, and moved to autonomous science operations on August 20, 2018, following a successful in-orbit checkout period. On September 29, 2018, ECOSTRESS experienced an anomaly with its primary mass storage unit (MSU). ECOSTRESS has a primary and secondary MSU (A and B). On December 5, 2018, the instrument was switched to the secondary MSU and science operations resumed. On March 14, 2019, the secondary MSU experienced a similar anomaly temporarily halting science acquisitions. On May 15, 2019, a new data acquisition approach was implemented and science acquisitions resumed. To optimize the new acquisition approach TIR bands 2, 4 and 5 are being downloaded. The data products are as previously, except the bands not downloaded contain fill values (L1 radiance and L2 emissivity). This approach was implemented from May 15, 2019, through April 28, 2023.\r\n*Data acquisition gap: From February 8 to February 16, 2020, an ECOSTRESS instrument issue resulted in a data anomaly that created striping in band 4 (10.5 micron). These data products have been reprocessed and are available for download. No ECOSTRESS data were acquired on February 17, 2020, due to the instrument being in SAFEHOLD. Data acquired following the anomaly have not been affected.\r\n*Data acquisition: ECOSTRESS has now successfully returned to 5-band mode after being in 3-band mode since 2019. This feature was successfully enabled following a Data Processing Unit firmware update (version 4.1) to the payload on April 28, 2023. To better balance contiguous science data scene variables, 3-band collection is currently being interleaved with 5-band acquisitions over the orbital day/night periods.\r\n",

    "description": "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.1 data products are now available in two production streams: one stream is forced with combined forcing data including GPCP version 1.3 (the main production stream), and the other stream is processed without this forcing data (the early production stream).  Since the GPCP Version 1.3 data have a 3-4 month latency, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are first created without it, and are designated as Early Products (EPs), with about 1.5 month latency.  Once the GPCP Version 1.3 data become available, the GLDAS-2.1 data products are processed in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Products archive.  \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.1 VIC 1.0 degree monthly dataset. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 VIC 1.0 degree monthly data product, was generated through temporal averaging of GLDAS-2.1 VIC 3-hourly data simulated with the VIC Land Surface Model 4.1.2 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7.  The data product contains 34 land surface fields from January 2000 to present.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 simulation started on January 1, 2000 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 simulation. This simulation was forced with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) atmospheric analysis fields (Derber et al., 1991), the disaggregated Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) V1.3 Daily Analysis precipitation fields (Adler et al., 2003; Huffman et al., 2001), and the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRicultural METeorological modeling system (AGRMET) radiation fields.  The simulation used with GDAS and GPCP only from 2000 to February 2001, followed by addition of AGRMET for March 1, 2001 onwards.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 products supersede their corresponding GLDAS-1 products.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.1 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nEstimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.\n\nThe method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types—convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)—were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The CSH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.\n\nBecause observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the CSH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.\n\n",

AOD1B products are 3-hourly series of spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 180 which are routinely provided to the GRACE Science Data System and the user community with only a few days time delay. These products reflect spatio-temporal mass variations in the atmosphere and oceans deduced from an operational atmospheric model and corresponding ocean dynamics provided by an ocean model. The variability is derived by subtraction of a long-term mean of vertical integrated atmospheric mass distributions and a corresponding mean of ocean bottom pressure as simulated with the ocean model. For further details, please refer to https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/aod1b/.\r\n\r\nThe Gridded AOD1B data sets provided here contain the monthly mean AOD1B data in geolocated gridded form, smoothed or spatially aggregated to be consistent with the GRACE and GRACE-FO Tellus Level-3 data products of land and/or ocean mass anomalies. With these gridded AOD1B Level-3 products, users can remove or add the effects of the modeled mean monthly atmospheric and ocean bottom pressure change (e.g., to compare different models).",

    "description": "The Spatial Statistical Data Fusion (SSDF) surface continental United States (CONUS) products, fuse data from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) instrument on the EOS-Aqua spacecraft with data from the Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS) instruments on the Suomi-NPP spacecraft.  The CrIMSS instrument suite consists of the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) infrared sounder and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) microwave sounder. This data set provides an estimate of the vapor pressure deficit.  It infers a value for each grid point based on nearby and distant values of the input Level-2 datasets and estimates of the variance of those values, with lower variances given higher weight. These are all daily products on a ¼ x ¼ degree latitude/longitude grid covering the continental United States (CONUS).  \n\nThe SSDF algorithm infers a value for each grid point based on nearby and distant values of the input Level-2 datasets and estimates of the variance of those values, with lower variances given higher weight. Performing the data fusion of two (or more) remote sensing datasets that estimate the same physical state involves four major steps: (1) Filtering input data; (2) Matching the remote sensing datasets to an in situ dataset, taken as a truth estimate; (3) Using these matchups to characterize the input datasets via estimation of their bias and variance relative to the truth estimate; (4) Performing the spatial statistical data fusion. We note that SSDF can also be performed on a single remote sensing input dataset. The SSDF algorithm only ingests the bias-corrected estimates, their latitudes and longitudes, and their estimated variances; the algorithm is agnostic as to which dataset or datasets those estimates, latitudes, longitudes, and variances originated from.",

The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere.

Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nEstimating vertical profiles of latent heating released by precipitating cloud systems is one of the key objectives of TRMM, together with accurately measuring the horizontal distribution of tropical rainfall.\n\nThe method uses TRMM PR information [precipitation-top height (PTH), precipitation rates at the surface and melting level, and rain type] to select heating profiles from lookup tables. Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types—convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a melting level)—were derived from numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems from the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) utilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM). The SLH algorithm is severely limited by the inherent sensitivity of the TRMM PR. For latent heating, the quantity required is actually cloud top, but the PR can detect only precipitation-sized particles.\n\nBecause observed information on precipitation depth is used in addition to precipitation type and intensity, differences between shallow and deep convection are more distinct in the SLH algorithm in comparison with the CSH algorithm.\n\n",

Innovations have been traditionally used to diagnose observation, background and analysis errors at observation locations (Hollingsworth and Lonnberg 1989; Dee and da Silva 1999). At the most simplistic level, innovation variances can be used as an upper bound on background errors, which are, in turn, an upper bound on the analysis errors. With more processing (and the assumption of optimality), the O-F and O-A statistics can be used to estimate observation, background and analysis errors (Desroziers et al. 2005). They can also be used to estimate the systematic and random errors in the analysis fields. Unfortunately, such data are usually not readily available with reanalysis products. With MERRA, however, a gridded version of the observations and innovations used in the assimilation process is being made available. The dataset allows the user to conveniently perform investigations related to the observing system and to calculate error estimates. Da Silva (2011) provides an overview and analysis of these datasets for MERRA. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe innovations may be thought of as the correction to the background required by a given instrument, while the analysis increment (A-F) is the consolidated correction once all instruments, observation errors, and background errors have been taken into consideration. The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other.

The extent to which the O-F statistics for the various instruments are similar to the A-F statistics reflects the degree of homogeneity of the observing system as a whole. Using the joint probability density function (PDF) of innovations and analysis increments, da Silva (2011) introduces the concepts of the effective gain (by analogy with the Kalman gain) and the contextual bias. In brief, the effective gain for an observation is a measure of how much the assimilation system has drawn to that type of observation, while the contextual bias is a measure of the degree of agreement between a given observation type and all other observations assimilated.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWith MERRAs gridded observation and innovation data sets, a wealth of information is available for examination of the quality of the analyses and how the different observations impact the analyses and interact with each other. Such examinations can be conducted regionally or globally and should provide useful information for the next generation of reanalyses.",

This method, which is hydrodynamic model- and a priori data-dependent, is designated as the so-called Path A scheme by the TOVS Pathfinder Science Working Group. The 20 channel High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder 2 (HIRS2) and the 4 channel Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) aboard the NOAA-xx series of Polar Orbiting Satellites are used to produce global fields of the 3-dimensional temperature-moisture structure of the atmosphere.

    "title": "SBUV2/NOAA-17 Ozone (O3) Profile and Total Column Ozone 1 Month Zonal Mean L3 Global 5.0 degree Latitude Zones V1 (SBUV2N17L3zm) at GES DISC",
    "description": "The Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV) from NOAA-17 Level-3 monthly zonal mean (MZM) product (SBUV2N17L3zm) is derived from the Level-2 retrieved ozone profiles. Ozone retrievals are generated from the v8.6 SBUV algorithm. A Level-3 MZM file computes zonal means covering 5 degree latitude bands for each calendar month. For this product there are 126 months of data from August 2002 through January 2013. There are a total of 36 latitudinal bands, 18 in each hemisphere. Profile data are provided at 21 layers from 1013.25, 639.318, 403.382,254.517, 160.589, 101.325,63.9317, 40.3382, 25.4517, 16.0589, 10.1325, 6.39317,4.03382, 2.54517, 1.60589, 1.01325,0.639317, 0.403382, 0.254517, 0.160589 and 0.101325 hPa (measured at bottom of layer). NOTE: Some profiles have 20 layers and do not report the top most layer. Mixing ratios are reported at 15 layers from 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0 and 50.0 hPa (measured at middle of layer). \n\nThe MZM product averages retrievals that meet the criteria for a good retrieval as determined by error flags in the Level 2 data. A good retrieval is defined as satisfying the following conditions:\n\n 1) Profile Error Flag = 0 or 1 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = solar zenith angle &gt; 84 degrees).\n 2) Total Error Flags = 0, 1, 2 or 5 (0 = good retrieval; 1 = not used; 2 = solar zenith angle &gt; 84 degrees; large discrepancy between profile total and best total ozone).\n\nNOTE - Total error flag = 5 is anomalously applied at high latitudes and high solar zenith angles where the B-Pair total ozone estimate is not as reliable as the ozone profile under these conditions. This error flag may be removed in future version of algorithm.\n\nThe zonal means computed for each month are screened according to the following statistical criteria:\n\n 1) Number of good retrievals for the month greater than or equal to 2/3 of the samples for a nominal month.\n 2) Mean latitude of good retrievals less than or equal to 1 degree from center of latitude band.\n 3) Mean time of good retrievals less than or equal to 4 days from center of month (i.e., day = 15).",

    "title": "S-MODE Waveglider Observations",
    "description": "This dataset contains waveglider observations from the Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S-MODE) field campaign. The experiment was conducted approximately 300 km offshore of San Francisco, during a pilot campaign that spanned two weeks in October 2021, and two intensive operating periods in Fall 2022 and Spring 2023. S-MODE aims to understand how ocean dynamics acting on short spatial scales influence the vertical exchange of physical and biological variables in the ocean. Three wave gliders were deployed as part of the S-MODE pilot campaign, equipped with a suite of sensors including sonic anemometers, shortwave and longwave radiometers, CTD profilers, and ADCPs. All wave gliders include an IMU that records platform orientation and motion at 20Hz. Data are available in netCDF format.",

    "title": "VEMAP 2: Annual Ecosystem Model Responses to U.S. Climate Change, 1994-2100",
    "description": "Phase 2 of the VEMAP Project developed historical (1895-1993) gridded data sets of climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, humidity, and wind speed) and projected (1994-2100) gridded annual and monthly climate data sets using output from two climate system models [CCCma (Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis) and Hadley Centre models]. Two Phase 2 model experiments were run.  First, a set of selected  biogeochemical models and coupled biogeochemical-biogeographical models were run from 1895 to 1993 to compare model responses to the historical time series and current ecosystem biogeochemistry.  Second, these same models were run on the projected 1994 to 2100 data to compare their ecological responses to transient scenarios of climate and atmospheric CO2 change. Model runs were performed for daily, monthly, and annual gridded data sets. The output of the annual model runs in VEMAP grid format are contained in this data set. The models investigated included five biogeochemical cycling models, which simulate plant production and nutrient cycles.",
